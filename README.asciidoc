= ci.erlang.mk

An https://erlang.mk/[Erlang.mk] plugin that maintains a list
of Erlang/OTP versions in their most recent patch version. It
allows configuring a project as supporting `OTP-19+`, for example,
and automatically fills in the `CI_OTP` or other relevant variables
with the most up to date list of versions.

Please consult 'early-plugins.mk' for a detailed list of
allowed values. You may also define your own values
by creating the corresponding variable.

This project also contains GitHub Actions workflows that can
be used to automatically test Erlang.mk applications. Note
that in this scenario the OTP versions used are not built
by the plugin; instead the erlef/setup-beam action is used.
But this plugin does provide the list of OTP releases to
test against.
