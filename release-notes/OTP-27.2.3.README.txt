# ssl-11.2.8

Note! The ssl-11.2.8 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- public_key-1.16.4 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1.3)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Setting protocol version to a lower value then supported by default in server
  API function called after ssl:listen/2 could result in wrong default values
  being used and connections failing with insufficient security.

- Improve error handling of server name indication fun. This implies that if the
  `sni_fun` returns `undefined` we will attempt connection with original option
  values, if it returns `unrecognized` we end the connection with
  UNRECOGNIZED_NAME alert and if provided options fail option verification we
  will end the connection with a HANDSHAKE_FAILURE and an error log.
