Check out the git tag OTP-27.2.2, and build a full OTP system including
documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your
installation using the 'otp_patch_apply' tool. For information on install
requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# compiler-8.5.5

The compiler-8.5.5 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Eliminated a bug in the alias analysis pass that could potentially cause
  unsafe optimizations of binary construction or record updates.

# erts-15.2.2

The erts-15.2.2 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Disabled an unsafe runtime optimization in binary construction that caused
  silent memory corruption.

# kernel-10.2.2

Note! The kernel-10.2.2 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-15.1 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed a couple of bugs that could make `global`'s internal state inconsistent
  when a connection was reconnected.

# public_key-1.17.1

The public_key-1.17.1 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Consider keyCertSign to compatible with extended key usage for TLS
  client/server auth in CAs, adhere to wide spread implementations

# ssl-11.2.7

Note! The ssl-11.2.7 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- public_key-1.16.4 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1.3)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- An initiated handshake should always be closed with an alert, some corner
  cases have been fixed so that this should always be the case.

  Own Id: OTP-19411
  Related Id(s): ERIERL-1174, PR-9273

- Correct option handling to work properly for paused handshaking. Could result
  in unwanted alerts or or error messages.
