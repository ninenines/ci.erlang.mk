Check out the git tag OTP-27.3.3, and build a full OTP system including
documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your
installation using the 'otp_patch_apply' tool. For information on install
requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# erts-15.2.6

The erts-15.2.6 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed bug in `call_memory` tracing that could cause wildly incorrect reported
  memory values. Bug exists since OTP 27.1.

  Also fixed return type spec of trace:info/3.

# kernel-10.2.6

Note! The kernel-10.2.6 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-15.2.5 (first satisfied in OTP 27.3.2)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed bug in `call_memory` tracing that could cause wildly incorrect reported
  memory values. Bug exists since OTP 27.1.

  Also fixed return type spec of trace:info/3.

# megaco-4.7.2

The megaco-4.7.2 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Corrected type spec for type mid().

# ssh-5.2.10

The ssh-5.2.10 application can be applied independently of other applications on
a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Reception of wrong Unicode does not cause unnecessary processing. US-ASCII
  fields are not decoded as Unicode.

  Own Id: OTP-19582
  Related Id(s): PR-9679

- SSH daemon disconnects upon receiving connection protocol message for
  unauthenticated used.

# ssl-11.2.12

Note! The ssl-11.2.12 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- public_key-1.16.4 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1.3)

## Improvements and New Features

- Lower log level for user cancelation as this is not an error case. Also handle
  possible undecrypted close alert during TLS-1.3 handshake.
