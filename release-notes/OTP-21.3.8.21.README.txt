 --- erts-10.3.5.16 --------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note! The erts-10.3.5.16 application *cannot* be applied
       independently of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 21
       installation.

       On a full OTP 21 installation, also the following runtime
       dependencies have to be satisfied:
       -- kernel-6.1 (first satisfied in OTP 21.1)
       -- sasl-3.3 (first satisfied in OTP 21.2)


 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17185    Application(s): erts

               Fixed a bug that could cause some work scheduled for
               execution on scheduler threads to be delayed until
               other similar work appeared. Beside delaying various
               cleanup of internal data structures also the following
               could be delayed:

               -- Termination of a distribution controller process

               -- Disabling of the distribution on a node

               -- Gathering of memory allocator information using the
               instrument module

               -- Enabling, disabling, and gathering of msacc
               information

               -- Delivery of 'CHANGE' messages when time offset is
               monitored

               -- A call to erlang:cancel_timer()

               -- A call to erlang:read_timer()

               -- A call to erlang:statistics(io | garbage_collection
               | scheduler_wall_time)

               -- A call to ets:all()

               -- A call to erlang:memory()

               -- A call to erlang:system_info({allocator |
               allocator_sizes, _})

               -- A call to erlang:trace_delivered()

               The bug existed on runtime systems running on all types
               of hardware except for x86/x86_64.
