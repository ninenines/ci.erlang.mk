 Check out the git tag OTP-22.3.4.17, and build a full OTP system
 including documentation. Apply one or more applications from this
 build as patches to your installation using the 'otp_patch_apply'
 tool. For information on install requirements, see descriptions for
 each application version below.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- erts-10.7.2.9 ---------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note! The erts-10.7.2.9 application *cannot* be applied independently
       of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 22 installation.

       On a full OTP 22 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- kernel-6.5.1 (first satisfied in OTP 22.2)


 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17253    Application(s): erts

               Fixed a bug in the timer implementation which could
               cause timers that were set to more than 37.25 hours in
               the future to be delayed. This could occur if there
               were multiple timers scheduled to be triggered very
               close in time, but still at different times, and the
               scheduler thread handling the timers was not able to
               handle them quickly enough. Delayed timers were in this
               case triggered when another unrelated timer was
               triggered.


  OTP-17290    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): GH-4635

               Fix bug in call_time tracing (used by eprof) that could
               cause VM crash. Bug exists since OTP-22.2 (but not in
               OTP-23).


 --- Improvements and New Features ---

  OTP-17244    Application(s): erts

               Fix a file descriptor leak when using sendfile and the
               remote side closes the connection. This bug has been
               present since OTP-21.0.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- kernel-6.5.2.2 --------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note! The kernel-6.5.2.2 application *cannot* be applied
       independently of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 22
       installation.

       On a full OTP 22 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-10.6 (first satisfied in OTP 22.2)


 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17223    Application(s): kernel
               Related Id(s): GH-4546, PR-4554

               When running Xref in the modules mode, the Debugger
               application would show up as a depency for the Kernel
               applications.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- ssh-4.9.1.3 -----------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note! The ssh-4.9.1.3 application *cannot* be applied independently
       of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 22 installation.

       On a full OTP 22 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- crypto-4.6.4 (first satisfied in OTP 22.2.2)


 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17279    Application(s): ssh

               The idle_time timer was not cancelled when a channel
               was opened within the timeout time on an empty
               connection that have had channels previously.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- tools-3.3.1.1 ---------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The tools-3.3.1.1 application can be applied independently of other
 applications on a full OTP 22 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17162    Application(s): tools
               Related Id(s): GH-4549, PR-2997, PR-4555,
               elixir-lang/elixir#10666

               cover would crash when compiling a module having an
               exported function named clauses.
