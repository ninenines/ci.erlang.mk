# erts-15.2.7.4

The erts-15.2.7.4 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Improvements and New Features

- Option(s) to create `gen_tcp` and `socket` sockets with protocol IPPROTO_MPTCP
  has been implemented.

  See functions gen_tcp:listen/2, gen_tcp:connect/4 and the type

# kernel-10.2.7.3

Note! The kernel-10.2.7.3 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-15.2.5 (first satisfied in OTP 27.3.2)
