 --- HIGHLIGHTS ------------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  OTP-12392    Application(s): ssl

               Add upper limit for session cache, configurable on ssl
               application level.

               If upper limit is reached, invalidate the current cache
               entries, e.i the session lifetime is the max time a
               session will be keept, but it may be invalidated
               earlier if the max limit for the table is reached. This
               will keep the ssl manager process well behaved, not
               exhusting memeory. Invalidating the entries will
               incrementally empty the cache to make room for fresh
               sessions entries.

 --- asn1-4.0.1 ------------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The asn1-4.0.1 application can be applied independently of other
 applications on a full OTP 18 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-13149    Application(s): asn1

               Trying to encode an empty named BIT STRING in BER would
               fail with a function_clause exception. (Thanks to
               Svilen Ivanov for reporting this bug.)

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- common_test-1.11.1 ----------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The common_test-1.11.1 application can be applied independently of
 other applications on a full OTP 18 installation.

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-13007    Application(s): common_test

               When data from the netconf server was split into many
               ssh packages, the netconf client performed really bad.
               This is now improved.


  OTP-13008    Application(s): common_test

               In ct_netconfc, if a timer expired 'at the same time'
               as the server sent the rpc-reply, the timeout message
               might already be in the client's message queue when the
               client removed the timer ref from its 'pending' list.
               This caused a crash in the client since the timer ref
               could no longer be found when handling the timeout
               message. This problem is now fixed by always flushing
               the timeout message from the message queue when
               canceling a timer.


  OTP-13035    Application(s): common_test

               The error logger handler ct_conn_log_h did not respect
               the 'silent' option, and tried to print to an undefined
               file descriptor. This has been corrected.


  OTP-13173    Application(s): common_test
               Related Id(s): seq12978

               If the user would let the test run proceed after test
               suite compilation failure, Common Test did not set the
               exit status to indicate failure as expected. This has
               been corrected. Also, the 'abort_if_missing_suites'
               option now makes Common Test abort the test run without
               asking the user if compilation fails, even if access to
               stdin/stdout exists.


  OTP-13181    Application(s): common_test, test_server

               With the Common Test 'create_priv_dir' start option set
               to 'auto_per_tc', the name of the priv directory for a
               configuration function could clash with the name of the
               priv directory for a test case, which would cause Test
               Server failure. This error has been corrected.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note! The dialyzer-2.8.2 application can *not* be applied
       independently of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 18
       installation.

       On a full OTP 18 installation, also the following runtime

 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-13137    Application(s): diameter

               Fix request table leaks

               The End-to-End and Hop-by-Hop identifiers of outgoing
               Diameter requests are stored in a table in order for
               the caller to be located when the corresponding answer
               message is received. Entries were orphaned if the
               handler was terminated by an exit signal as a
               consequence of actions taken by callback functions, or
               if callbacks modified identifiers in retransmission
               cases.

               Fix memory corruption bug caused by disabling
               distribution and then re-enable distribution with a
               node name that has previously been used by a remote
               node.


  OTP-13079    Application(s): erts

               Renamed variables with name bool as Visual Studio 2015
               now treats this is a keyword.


  OTP-13102    Application(s): erts

               erl_prim_loader has not supported custom loaders for
               several releases. In the documentation for
               erl_prim_loader, all references to custom loaders have
               now been removed.


  OTP-13105    Application(s): erts

  OTP-13125    Application(s): erts

               Fix maps decode in erlang:binary_to_term/1

               Decoding a term with a large (HAMT) map in an small
               (FLAT) map could cause a critical error if the external
               format was not produced by beam.


  OTP-13146    Application(s): erts

               Fix very rare bug in GC when big maps with a lot of
               hash collisions from a remote node are waiting in inner
               message queue.


  OTP-13150    Application(s): erts

               Fixed a bug that could cause a crash dump to become
               almost empty.

               field.


  OTP-13068    Application(s): dialyzer, hipe

               Reintroduce the erlang:make_fun/3 BIF in erl_bif_types.


  OTP-13092    Application(s): hipe

               In certain cases of matching with very big binaries,
               the HiPE compiler generated code that would fail the
               match, even in cases that the matching was successful.
               The problem was more quite noticeable on 32-bit
               platforms.

               response, when problems, such as a timeout occurs.


  OTP-13117    Application(s): inets

               HTTP client terminates gracefully when an invalid
               chunked length header is encountered.

               Be forgiving to chunked sizes that have trailing
               whitespaces as prior implementation was. Also some
               legacy embedded devices does actually have trailing
               whitespaces even though this in not according to the
               spec.

               RFC 4343. Patch by Holger Wei√ü.


  OTP-13040    Application(s): kernel

               IPv6 distribution handler has been updated to share
               code with IPv4 so that all features are supported in

               Cooked file mode buffering has been fixed so
               file:position/2 now works according to Posix on Posix
               systems i.e. when file:position/2 returns an error the
               file pointer is unaffected.

               The Windows system documentation, however, is unclear
               on this point so the documentation of file:position/2
               still does not promise anything.

               Cooked file mode file:pread/2,3 and file:pwrite/2,3
               have been corrected to honor character encoding like
               the combination of file:position/2 and file:read/2 or
               file:write/2 already does. This is probably not very
               useful since the character representation on the
               caller's side is latin1, period.
