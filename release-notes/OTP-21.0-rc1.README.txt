  OTP-14370    Application(s): erts

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Truly asynchronous auto-connect. Earlier, when
               erlang:send was done toward an unconnected node, the
               function would not return until the connection setup
               had completed (or failed). Now the function returns
               directly after the signal has been enqueued and the
               connection setup started.

               The same applies to all distributed operations that may
               trigger auto-connect, i.e. '!', send, link, monitor,
               monitor_node, exit/2 and group_leader.

               The interface for all these functions are unchanged as
               they do not return connection failures. The only
               exception is erlang:monitor where a *possible
               incompatibility* is introduced: An attempt to monitor a
               process on a primitive node (such as erl_interface or
               jinterface), where remote process monitoring is not
               implemented, will no longer fail with badarg exception.
               Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only
               supervise the connection to the node.

               New functionality for implementation of alternative
               carriers for the Erlang distribution has been
               introduced. This mainly consists of support for usage
               of distribution controller processes (previously only
               ports could be used as distribution controllers). For
               more information see ERTS User's Guide ➜ How to
               implement an Alternative Carrier for the Erlang
               Distribution ➜ Distribution Module.


  OTP-14497    Application(s): compiler, erts

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Support for "tuple calls" have been removed from the
               run-time system. Tuple calls was an undocumented and
               unsupported feature which allowed the module argument
               for an apply operation to be a tuple: Var = dict:new(),
               Var:size(). This "feature" frequently caused confuses,
               especially when such call failed. The stacktrace would
               point out functions that don't exist in the source
               code.

               For legacy code that need to use parameterized modules
               or tuple calls for some other reason, there is a new
               compiler option called tuple_calls. When this option is
               given, the compiler will generate extra code that
               emulates the old behavior for calls where the module is
               a variable.


  OTP-14502    Application(s): erts

               Creation of small maps with literal keys has been
               optimized to be faster and potentially use less memory
               . The keys are combined into a literal key tuple which
               is put into the literal pool. The key tuple can be
               shared between many instances of maps having the same
               keys.


  OTP-14518    Application(s): erts, otp

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The non-smp emulators have been removed. This means
               that the configure options --disable-threads and
               --enable-plain-emulator have been removed and configure
               will now refuse to build Erlang/OTP on platforms
               without thread support.

               In order to achieve a similar setup as the non-smp
               emulator, it is possible to start Erlang/OTP with the
               +S 1 option.


  OTP-14626    Application(s): compiler, erts

               Loaded BEAM code in a 64-bit system requires less
               memory because of better packing of operands for
               instructions.

               These memory savings were achieved by major
               improvements to the beam_makeops scripts used when
               building the run time system and BEAM compiler. There
               is also new for documentation for beam_makeops that
               describes how new BEAM instructions and loader
               transformations can be implemented. The documentation
               is found in here in a source directory or git
               repository: erts/emulator/internal_doc/beam_makeops.md.
               An online version can be found here:

  OTP-14692    Application(s): compiler, erts

               There is a new syntax in 'try/catch' for retrieving the
               stacktrace without calling 'erlang:get_stacktrace/0'.
               See the reference manual for a description of the new
               syntax. The 'erlang:get_stacktrace/0' BIF is now
               deprecated.


  OTP-14899    Application(s): erts, kernel

               seq_trace labels may now be any erlang term.


  OTP-14928    Application(s): erts

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The number of driver async threads will now default to
               1 as the standard drivers do not use them anymore.
               Users that changed this value to tweak the file driver
               should replace +A with +SDio since it now uses dirty IO
               schedulers instead of async threads.


  OTP-14968    Application(s): compiler
               Related Id(s): ERL-563

               When compiling modules with huge functions, the
               compiler would generate a lot of atoms for its
               internal, sometimes so many that the atom table would
               overflow. The compiler has been rewritten to generate
               far less internal atoms to avoid filling the atom
               table.

  OTP-11694    Application(s): erts

               The erlang:system_flag(scheduler_wall_time,Bool) call
               is now reference counted and will be turned off if the
               (last) process that started the performance statistics
               dies. Thus it is no longer possible to start the
               statistics with rpc:call(Node, erlang, system_flag,
               [scheduler_wall_time, true]) since it will be turned
               off directly afterwards when the rpc process dies.


  OTP-13073    Application(s): stdlib
               Related Id(s): PR-1595

               The semantics of timeout parameter
               {clean_timeout,infinity} to gen_statem:call/3 has been
               changed to use a proxy process for the call. With this
               change clean_timeout implicates a proxy process with no
               exceptions. This may be a hard to observe
               incompatibility: in the presence of network problems a
               late reply could arrive in the caller's message queue
               when catching errors. That will not happen after this
               correction.

               The semantics of timeout parameter infinity has not
               been changed.


  OTP-13761    Application(s): kernel
               Related Id(s): ERL-503

               No resolver backend returns V4Mapped IPv6 addresses any
               more. This was inconsistent before, some did, some did
               not. To facilitate working with such addresses a new
               function inet:ipv4_mapped_ipv6_address/1 has been
               added.


  OTP-14256    Application(s): erts

               The file driver has been rewritten as a NIF, decreasing
               the latency of file operations. Two notable
               incompatibilities are:

               -- The use_threads option for file:sendfile/5 no longer
               has any effect; we either use non-blocking sendfile(2)
               or fall back to file:read + gen_tcp:send.

               -- The file-specific DTrace probes have been removed.
               The same effect can be achieved with normal tracing
               together with the nif__entry/nif__return probes to
               track scheduling.

               jinterface), where remote process monitoring is not

               Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only
               supervise the connection to the node.


  OTP-14439    Application(s): compiler, dialyzer, erts, stdlib

               Changed the default behaviour of .erlang loading:
               .erlang is no longer loaded from the current directory.
               c:erlangrc(PathList) can be used to search and load an
               .erlang file from user specified directories.

               escript, erlc, dialyzer and typer no longer load an
               .erlang at all.

               File operations used to accept filenames containing
               null characters (integer value zero). This caused the
               name to be truncated and in some cases arguments to
               primitive operations to be mixed up. Filenames
               containing null characters inside the filename are now
               *rejected* and will cause primitive file operations to
               fail.

               Also environment variable operations used to accept
               names and values of environment variables containing
               null characters (integer value zero). This caused
               operations to silently produce erroneous results.
               Environment variable names and values containing null
               characters inside the name or value are now *rejected*
               and will cause environment variable operations to fail.

               Primitive environment variable operations also used to
               accept the $= character in environment variable names
               causing various problems. $= characters in environment
               variable names are now also *rejected*.

               Also os:cmd/1 now reject null characters inside its

               This is an incompatible change, but note that the use
               of backslashes in wildcards would already work
               differently on Windows and Unix. Existing calls to
               filelib:wildcard() needs to be updated. On Windows,

               *not* kept in sync with libc getenv(3) / putenv(3), so
               those who relied on that behavior in drivers or NIFs
               will need to add manual synchronization.

               On Windows this means that you can no longer resolve
               DLL dependencies by modifying the PATH just before
               loading the driver/NIF. To make this less of a problem,

               Support for "tuple calls" have been removed from the
               run-time system. Tuple calls was an undocumented and
               unsupported feature which allowed the module argument
               for an apply operation to be a tuple: Var = dict:new(),
               Var:size(). This "feature" frequently caused confuses,
               especially when such call failed. The stacktrace would
               point out functions that don't exist in the source
               code.

               For legacy code that need to use parameterized modules
               or tuple calls for some other reason, there is a new
               compiler option called tuple_calls. When this option is
               given, the compiler will generate extra code that
               emulates the old behavior for calls where the module is
               a variable.

               Loaded BEAM code in a 64-bit system requires less
               memory because of better packing of operands for
               instructions.

               These memory savings were achieved by major
               improvements to the beam_makeops scripts used when
               building the run time system and BEAM compiler. There
               is also new for documentation for beam_makeops that

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               File operations used to accept filenames containing
               null characters (integer value zero). This caused the
               name to be truncated and in some cases arguments to
               primitive operations to be mixed up. Filenames
               containing null characters inside the filename are now
               *rejected* and will cause primitive file operations to
               fail.

               Also environment variable operations used to accept
               names and values of environment variables containing
               null characters (integer value zero). This caused
               operations to silently produce erroneous results.
               Environment variable names and values containing null
               characters inside the name or value are now *rejected*
               and will cause environment variable operations to fail.

               Primitive environment variable operations also used to
               accept the $= character in environment variable names
               causing various problems. $= characters in environment
               variable names are now also *rejected*.

               Also os:cmd/1 now reject null characters inside its
               command.

               erlang:open_port/2 will also reject null characters
               inside the port name from now on.

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               os:putenv and os:getenv no longer access the process
               environment directly and instead work on a thread-safe
               emulation. The only observable difference is that it's
               *not* kept in sync with libc getenv(3) / putenv(3), so
               those who relied on that behavior in drivers or NIFs
               will need to add manual synchronization.

               On Windows this means that you can no longer resolve
               DLL dependencies by modifying the PATH just before
               loading the driver/NIF. To make this less of a problem,
               the emulator now adds the target DLL's folder to the
               DLL search path.

               gen_sctp:connect_init/4 or rather connect in inet_drv.c

               The file driver has been rewritten as a NIF, decreasing
               the latency of file operations. Two notable
               incompatibilities are:

               -- The use_threads option for file:sendfile/5 no longer
               has any effect; we either use non-blocking sendfile(2)
               or fall back to file:read + gen_tcp:send.

               -- The file-specific DTrace probes have been removed.
               The same effect can be achieved with normal tracing
               together with the nif__entry/nif__return probes to
               track scheduling.


  OTP-14346    Application(s): erts

               The I/O polling functionality of erts has been
               re-written to better make use of the OSs polling
               mechanisms. This change means that erts will now always
               prefer to use a kernel-polling mechanism if possible.
               Also all of the I/O polling has been moved to dedicated
               threads instead of being placed in the scheduler loops.

               As a result of this, the erl options +K and +secio have
               been removed. It is still possible to disable
               kernel-poll, but it has to be done at compile time
               through the configure option --disable-kernel-poll.

               The new erl options +IOt and +IOp can be used to change
               how many IO poll threads and poll sets that erts should
               use. See their respective documentation for more
               details.

               Truly asynchronous auto-connect. Earlier, when
               erlang:send was done toward an unconnected node, the
               function would not return until the connection setup
               had completed (or failed). Now the function returns
               directly after the signal has been enqueued and the
               connection setup started.

               The same applies to all distributed operations that may
               trigger auto-connect, i.e. '!', send, link, monitor,
               monitor_node, exit/2 and group_leader.

               The interface for all these functions are unchanged as
               they do not return connection failures. The only
               exception is erlang:monitor where a *possible
               incompatibility* is introduced: An attempt to monitor a
               process on a primitive node (such as erl_interface or
               jinterface), where remote process monitoring is not
               implemented, will no longer fail with badarg exception.
               Instead a monitor will be created, but it will only
               supervise the connection to the node.

               Support for "tuple calls" have been removed from the
               run-time system. Tuple calls was an undocumented and
               unsupported feature which allowed the module argument
               for an apply operation to be a tuple: Var = dict:new(),
               Var:size(). This "feature" frequently caused confuses,
               especially when such call failed. The stacktrace would
               point out functions that don't exist in the source
               code.

               For legacy code that need to use parameterized modules
               or tuple calls for some other reason, there is a new
               compiler option called tuple_calls. When this option is
               given, the compiler will generate extra code that

               caught. That will save time and produce less garbage.
               There are also some minor optimizations of 'try/catch'
               both in the compiler and run-time system.

               delayed in order to be piggybacked with the sent

               New implementation of erlang:process_info/[1,2].

               In the general case when inspecting another process,
               the new implementation sends an asynchronous
               process-info request signal to the other process and
               waits for the result instead of locking the other
               process and reading the result directly. In some
               special cases where no conflicts occur, signal order
               wont be violated, and the amount of data requested is
               guaranteed to be small, the inspected process may be
               inspected directly.

               and recreated with the same name during the iteration.
               The iteration could incorrectly continue through the
               recreated table. The expected correct behavior is now
               for the iteration call to fail with a badarg exception
               if the table is deleted before the iteration has
               completed.

               Note that the functions encode/1, decode/1, and
               mime_decode/1 fail unless called with an argument of
               the documented type. They used to accept any iodata().

               The stack traces returned by the functions of the
               erl_eval module more accurately reflect where the
               exception occurred.

               Improved URI normalization functions in the uri_string
               module.


  OTP-14983    Application(s): stdlib

               The new functions io_lib:fwrite/3 and io_lib:format/3
               take a third argument, an option list. The only option
               is chars_limit, which is used for limiting the number
               of returned characters. The limit is soft, which means
               that the number of returned characters exceeds the
               limit with at most a smallish amount. If the limit is
               set, the functions format/3 and fwrite/3 try to
               distribute the number of characters evenly over the
               control sequences pPswW. Furthermore, the control
               sequences pPwP try to distribute the number of
               characters evenly over substructures.

               A modification of the control sequences pPwW is that
               even if there is no limit on the number of returned
               characters, all associations of a map are printed to
               the same depth. The aim is to give a more consistent
               output as the order of map keys is not defined. As
               before, if the depth is less than the number of
               associations of a map, the selection of associations to
               print is arbitrary.

  OTP-15003    Application(s): compiler, stdlib

               External funs with literal values for module, name, and
               arity (e.g. erlang:abs/1) are now treated as literals.
               That means more efficient code that produces less
               garbage on the heap.

  OTP-15048    Application(s): stdlib

               A sys debug function can now have the format
               {Id,Fun,State} in addition to the old {Fun,State}. This
               allows installing multiple instances of a debug fun.
