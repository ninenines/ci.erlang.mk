 build as patches to your installation using the 'otp_patch_apply'
 tool. For information on install requirements, see descriptions for
 each application version below.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- erts-10.6.3 -----------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note! The erts-10.6.3 application *cannot* be applied independently
       of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 22 installation.

       On a full OTP 22 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- kernel-6.5.1 (first satisfied in OTP 22.2)


 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-16436    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): ERL-1152

               A process could end up in a state where it got
               endlessly rescheduled without making any progress. This
               occurred when a system task, such as check of process
               code (part of a code purge), was scheduled on a high
               priority process trying to execute on a dirty
               scheduler.


 --- Improvements and New Features ---

  OTP-16358    Application(s): erts

               Improved signal handling for processes executing dirty.
               For example, avoid busy wait in dirty signal handler
               process when process is doing garbage collection on
               dirty scheduler.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 --- stdlib-3.11.2 ---------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note! The stdlib-3.11.2 application *cannot* be applied independently
       of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 22 installation.

       On a full OTP 22 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-10.6.2 (first satisfied in OTP 22.2.2)


 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-16441    Application(s): stdlib

               A directory traversal vulnerability has been eliminated
               in erl_tar. erl_tar will now refuse to extract symlinks
               that points outside the targeted extraction directory
               and will return {error,{Path,unsafe_symlink}}. (Thanks
               to Eric Meadows-JÃ¶nsson for the bug report and for
               suggesting a fix.)
