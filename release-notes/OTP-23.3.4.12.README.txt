               By default global does not take any actions to restore
               a fully connected network when connections are lost due
               to network issues. This is problematic for all
               applications expecting a fully connected network to be
               provided, such as for example mnesia, but also for
               global itself. A network of overlapping partitions
               might cause the internal state of global to become
               inconsistent. Such an inconsistency can remain even
               after such partitions have been brought together to
               form a fully connected network again. The effect on
               other applications that expects that a fully connected
               network is maintained may vary, but they might
               misbehave in very subtle hard to detect ways during
               such a partitioning.

               In order to prevent such issues, we have introduced a
               prevent overlapping partitions fix which can be enabled
               using the prevent_overlapping_partitions kernel(6)
               parameter. When this fix has been enabled, global will
               actively disconnect from nodes that reports that they
               have lost connections to other nodes. This will cause
               fully connected partitions to form instead of leaving
               the network in a state with overlapping partitions.
               Note that this fix has to be enabled on all nodes in
               the network in order to work properly. Since this quite
               substantially changes the behavior, this fix is
               currently disabled by default. Since you might get hard
               to detect issues without this fix you are, however,
               strongly advised to enable this fix in order to avoid
               issues such as the ones described above. As of OTP 25
               this fix will become enabled by default.

  OTP-17905    Application(s): kernel
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-732, PR-5740

               A net_tickintensity kernel parameter has been
               introduced. It can be used to control the amount of
               ticks during a net_ticktime period.

               A new net_kernel:start/2 function has also been
               introduced in order to make it easier to add new
               options. The use of net_kernel:start/1 has been
               deprecated.
