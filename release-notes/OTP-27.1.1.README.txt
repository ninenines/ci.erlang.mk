Check out the git tag OTP-27.1.1, and build a full OTP system including
documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your
installation using the 'otp_patch_apply' tool. For information on install
requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# common_test-1.27.2

The common_test-1.27.2 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change, HTML reports include jQuery version 3.7.1.

# erts-15.1.1

The erts-15.1.1 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- On Windows, successive failed socket calls caused socket to become
  "uninitialized".

  Own Id: OTP-19251
  Related Id(s): #8853

- The socket framework fails to start on a IPv6-only Windows machine.

# public_key-1.16.3

The public_key-1.16.3 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Introduction of verify_fun/4 unfortunately introduced an argument switch for
  some specific path validation errors so that verify_fun/3 could under these
  circumstances be called with a DER cert instead of a decod cert, also in this
  situation the verify_fun/4 would have the certificates in reverse order.

## Improvements and New Features

- Do not hide crypto badarg reason, this error handling enhancement facilitates
  debugging. These kind of runtime errors are not documented and should never be
  relied on for matching, they are intended for catching input errors early.

# ssl-11.2.3

Note! The ssl-11.2.3 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- public_key-1.16.2 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Starting from TLS-1.3 some server handshake alerts might arrive after
  ssl:connection/2,3,4 has returned. If the socket is in active mode the
  controlling process will get the alert message, but passive sockets would only
  get {error, closed} on next call to ssl:recv/2,3 or ssl/setopts/2. Passive
  sockets calls will now return {error, error_alert()} instead.

  Own Id: OTP-19236

- Servers configured to support only version (pre TLS-1.2) should ignore hello
  version extension, as it is an unknown extension to them, this will result in
  that new clients that do not support the old server version will get an
  insufficient security alert from the server and not a protocol version alert,
  this is consistent with how old servers not able to support higher protocol
  versions work.

# stdlib-6.1.1

The stdlib-6.1.1 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Remove whitespace stripping of returned binaries in json:decode/3.

- Fix zip:unzip/2 to not crash when extracting zip files with garbage in the
  Zip64 extra header. This bug was introduced in Erlang 27.1 and has so far only
  been seen on some archives creates by MS Excel.

- With this change, shutdown procedure handles a race condition between
  supervisor executing a shutdown and child process termination from other
  reason.
