Check out the git tag OTP-28.3.1, and build a full OTP system including
documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your
installation using the 'otp_patch_apply' tool. For information on install
requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# megaco-4.8.2

The megaco-4.8.2 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 28 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The megaco_tcp module had debug unintentionally enabled.

# mnesia-4.25.1

The mnesia-4.25.1 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 28 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed bug where mnesia:del_table_copy/3 could fail when deleting a node that
  had tables which was not active anywhere.

# public_key-1.20.1

Note! The public_key-1.20.1 application _cannot_ be applied independently of
other applications on an arbitrary OTP 28 installation.

       On a full OTP 28 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- crypto-5.8 (first satisfied in OTP 28.3)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Add missing git ignore for SLH-DSA generates.

# ssl-11.5.1

Note! The ssl-11.5.1 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 28 installation.

       On a full OTP 28 installation, also the following runtime
       dependencies have to be satisfied:
       -- crypto-5.8 (first satisfied in OTP 28.3)
       -- public_key-1.18.3 (first satisfied in OTP 28.1)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Correct TLS-1.3 alert handling so server will always send the alert with the
  encryption keys that the client is expecting, that is if for instance if
  client certification fails the alert will be sent using application traffic
  encryption keys.

  Own Id: OTP-19795
  Related Id(s): PR-10465

- Correct TLS-1.3 session tickets documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-19891
  Related Id(s): PR-10481

- Corrected app environment handling for session callback that was broken In
  OTP-23.

# xmerl-2.1.8

The xmerl-2.1.8 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 28 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- XML regular expressions in XSD validation now handle `\s` and `\S` correctly.
