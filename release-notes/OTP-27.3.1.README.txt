Check out the git tag OTP-27.3.1, and build a full OTP system including
documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your
installation using the 'otp_patch_apply' tool. For information on install
requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# OTP-27.3.1

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Update used ExDoc version to v0.37.3

  Own Id: OTP-19525
  Related Id(s): PR-9553

# asn1-5.3.3

The asn1-5.3.3 application can be applied independently of other applications on
a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The JER backend will now include the SIZE constraint in the type info for
  OCTET STRINGs, and a SIZE constraint with a range will now be included for BIT
  STRINGs. This does not change the actual encoding or decoding of JER, but can
  be useful for tools.

  Related Id(s): ERIERL-1204, PR-9588

## Improvements and New Features

- When using the JSON encoding rules, it is now possible to call the decode/2
  function in the following way with data that has already been decoded by
  json:decode/1:

      SomeModule:decode(Type, {json_decoded, Decoded}).

# erts-15.2.4

The erts-15.2.4 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Behavior for socket:recv/3 has been improved. The behavior has also been
  clarified in the documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-19469
  Related Id(s): #9172

- Trace messages due to `receive` tracing could potentially be delayed a very
  long time if the traced process waited in a `receive` expression without
  clauses matching on messages (timed wait), or just did not enter a `receive`
  expression for a very long time.

  Own Id: OTP-19527
  Related Id(s): PR-9577

- Improve the naming of the (internal) esock mutex(es). It is now possible to
  configure (as in autoconf) the use of simple names for the esock mutex(es).

# kernel-10.2.4

Note! The kernel-10.2.4 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-15.1 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Behavior for socket:recv/3 has been improved. The behavior has also been
  clarified in the documentation.

  Own Id: OTP-19469
  Related Id(s): #9172

- An infinite loop in CNAME loop detection that can cause Out Of Memory has been
  fixed. This affected CNAME lookup with the internal DNS resolver.

# mnesia-4.23.5

The mnesia-4.23.5 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change mnesia will merge schema of tables using external backends.

# ssh-5.2.9

The ssh-5.2.9 application can be applied independently of other applications on
a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Reception of malicious KEX init message does not result with ssh daemon
  excessive memory usage.

  Own Id: OTP-19543
  Related Id(s): CVE-2025-30211

- Call to ssh:daemon_replace_options does not crash when argument is not a valid
  daemon ref.

# ssl-11.2.10

Note! The ssl-11.2.10 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- public_key-1.16.4 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1.3)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Correct handling of unassigned signature algorithms to properly ignore them
  instead of failing the handshake.

- Update key mechanism in CRL cache so that CRL DP with same URI path component
  becomes distinguishable from each other.

  Related Id(s): GH-8891, PR-9612

## Improvements and New Features

- Add callback for NSS keylogging so that it can work as expected for all
  scenarios.

# stdlib-6.2.2

The stdlib-6.2.2 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

  `process_dictionary`.
