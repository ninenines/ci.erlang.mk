# erts-15.1.2

The erts-15.1.2 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- A bug has been fixed where receiving an SCTP message with `gen_sctp` could
  waste the first fragments of a message and only deliver the last fragment.

  This happened with low probability when the OS signaled that the socket was
  ready for reading in combination with an internal time-out retry.

  A bug has been fixed with a lingering time-out from after an SCTP connect that
  could stop the flow of incoming messages on an active `gen_tcp` socket.

- An boolean option `non_block_send` for SCTP, has ben added to be able to
  achieve the old behaviour to avoid blocking send operations by passing the OS
  network stack error message (`{error,eagain}` through.

- The call gen_tcp:send/2 could hang indefinitely despite having set the
  `send_timeout` option for the following unfortunate combination of
  circumstances:

  - The socket has to be in passive mode.
  - All output buffers had to be filled util the `high_watermark` was hit,
    causing the gen_tcp:send/2 operation to block.
  - While the send operation was blocked, a `gen_tcp:recv/2,3` call had to be
    done from a different process. It had to block, waiting for data for a while
    before completing the operation, and the received packet had to fill at
    least 75% of the receive buffer.

  Under these circumstances he information that a send operation was waiting got
  lost, so the send operation that blocked in the first placed would never
  return. The data it had would be sent, though, and send operations from other
  processes, still work.

  This bug has been fixed.

- In rare circumstances, in code that matches multiple tuples, the JIT could
  generate code that would raise a `badmatch` exception even if the given tuples
  were correct.

- Fixed beam crash that could happen if resetting `call_time` or `call_memory`
  trace counters of a function while it is called. Bug exists since OTP R16.

# kernel-10.1.1

Note! The kernel-10.1.1 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-15.1 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1)

# ssh-5.2.3

The ssh-5.2.3 application can be applied independently of other applications on
a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change, a race condition is removed from ssh client connection setup
  procedure.

- With this change, ssh:connect is not affected by presence of EXIT message in
  queue.

- With this change, ssh appends {active, false} option after socket options
  received from user - so that false value is always used.

# ssl-11.2.4

Note! The ssl-11.2.4 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- public_key-1.16.2 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Refactor trying to also make some optimizations introduced a bug in signature
  algorithms checks in OTP-26.2.1. This could manifest itself in not being able
  to negotiate connections using certificates needing to use some TLS-1.2
  compatibility legacy signature schemes.

  Own Id: OTP-19249

- Correct timeout handling for termination code run for own alerts, so that
  intended timeout is used instead of falling back to OS TCP-stack timeout that
  is unreasonably long on some platforms.

- Fix assertion so that works as intended. This could result in that some
  TLS-1.2 clients would fail to connect to the the erlang server. Bug introduced
  in OTP-27.1.1

# stdlib-6.1.2

The stdlib-6.1.2 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change, uri_string:normalize assumes empty path (do not crash) when
  no path is provided in the URI map.
