Check out the git tag OTP-27.3.2, and build a full OTP system including
documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your
installation using the 'otp_patch_apply' tool. For information on install
requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# asn1-5.3.4

The asn1-5.3.4 application can be applied independently of other applications on
a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Negative REAL numbers greater than -1 would be incorrectly encoded (the minus
  sign would be lost).

# compiler-8.6.1

The compiler-8.6.1 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix the compiler crash when the inner-most tuple in a nested tuple with 3
  layers is updated.

# erts-15.2.5

The erts-15.2.5 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- On Windows, using socket:sendv, a large IOV (size > MAX), the tail was not
  sent.

  Own Id: OTP-19482

- Uplift pcre 8.44 to pcre 8.45

# kernel-10.2.5

Note! The kernel-10.2.5 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-15.2.5 (first satisfied in OTP 27.3.2)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- On Windows, using socket:sendv, a large IOV (size > MAX), the tail was not
  sent.

  Own Id: OTP-19482

- gen_tcp connect with a sockaddr with loopback address failed.

  Own Id: OTP-19560
  Related Id(s): GH-9541

- Remove debug printouts from gen_tcp_socket

# megaco-4.7.1

The megaco-4.7.1 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Correct type spec for ActionReply

# snmp-5.18.2

The snmp-5.18.2 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- When manager receives an v3 inform (request) it used engine-id and full
  address (including port number) to check if engine was known. This did not
  work if agent used ephemeral ports for notifications. Has now been changed to
  only use (context) engine-id and address (without port).

- Fixed snmp_generic (dialyzer) spec for function table_func.

# ssl-11.2.11

Note! The ssl-11.2.11 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- public_key-1.16.4 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1.3)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Correct the debug functionality for NSS keylogging for TLS-1.3 introduced in
  OTP-27.3.1 so that TLS-1.3 key updates items always get correct counter value
  and each item is logged as one single line.

# xmerl-2.1.2

The xmerl-2.1.2 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Corrected faulty type specification

  Corrected type specification for the input parameter of xmerl_xs:value_of/1.

  Also replaced underscore in the return type specifications of
  xmerl_xs:select/2, xmerl_xpath:string/2 and xmerl_xpath:string/3 with
  specified return values to improve documentation.
