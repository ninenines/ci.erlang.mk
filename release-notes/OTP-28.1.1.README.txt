Check out the git tag OTP-28.1.1, and build a full OTP system including
documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your
installation using the 'otp_patch_apply' tool. For information on install
requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# OTP-28.1.1

## Improvements and New Features

- When building OTP, some applications may be skipped due to lacking
  dependencies, or due to user choice. Such skipped applications are excluded
  from the docs build step and a placeholder page is displayed in their stead.

# diameter-2.5.2

The diameter-2.5.2 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 28 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Added documentation about 'proxy' and 'resend' options in
  diameter:handle_request/3

# erts-16.1.1

The erts-16.1.1 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 28 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed the `erl` documentation of the default timewarp mode used.

- The `erlang:suspend_process()` BIFs failed to suspend processes currently
  executing on dirty schedulers.

# kernel-10.4.1

The kernel-10.4.1 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 28 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change group.erl will not crash when receiving unknown message.

# ssl-11.4.1

Note! The ssl-11.4.1 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 28 installation.

       On a full OTP 28 installation, also the following runtime
       dependencies have to be satisfied:
       -- crypto-5.7 (first satisfied in OTP 28.1)
       -- public_key-1.18.3 (first satisfied in OTP 28.1)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed so that sending of application data will adhere to max_fragment_length.
  This was broken in OTP-27 release by an optimization.

- PR-10046 put to hard requirements on key file content. Make sure same file can
  be used as keyfile and certfile

- Assert that hello extensions are unique and send an illegal parameter alert if
  they are not.

- Avoid sending an internal message to the user process in conjunction with
  handling a key update.

# xmerl-2.1.7

The xmerl-2.1.7 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 28 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The XSD validation failed due to not handling the optional text blocks
  correctly in an XSD complex type with attribute `mixed=true`.
