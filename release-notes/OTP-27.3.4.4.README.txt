Check out the git tag OTP-27.3.4.4, and build a full OTP system including
documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your
installation using the 'otp_patch_apply' tool. For information on install
requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# diameter-2.4.1.1

The diameter-2.4.1.1 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Added documentation about 'proxy' and 'resend' options in
  diameter:handle_request/3

  Own Id: OTP-19768
  Related Id(s): GH-10150, PR-10182

> erts-10.0, kernel-3.2, ssl-9.0, stdlib-5.0

# erts-15.2.7.3

The erts-15.2.7.3 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed the `erl` documentation of the default timewarp mode used.

  Own Id: OTP-19790
  Related Id(s): PR-9970

- The `erlang:suspend_process()` BIFs failed to suspend processes currently
  executing on dirty schedulers.

  Own Id: OTP-19799
  Related Id(s): PR-10241

- When multiple processes called the same fun whose defining module was not
  loaded, a `badfun` exception could sometimes occur in one of the calling
  processes. This would only happen with the JIT runtime system.

# ssl-11.2.12.3

Note! The ssl-11.2.12.3 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- public_key-1.16.4 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1.3)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fixed so that sending of application data will adhere to max_fragment_length.
  This was broken in OTP-27 release by an optimization.

  Own Id: OTP-19774
  Related Id(s): GH-10191, PR-10201

- Assert that hello extensions are unique and send an illegal parameter alert if
  they are not.

  Own Id: OTP-19791
  Related Id(s): PR-10245

- Avoid sending an internal message to the user process in conjunction with
  handling a key update.

  Own Id: OTP-19806
  Related Id(s): PR-10274

- Graceful error handling added in negative test scenario.

  Own Id: OTP-19813
  Related Id(s): PR-10284

- Handle duplicate change_cipher_spec message with an unexpected message alert
  instead of failing later in corrupted state.

  Own Id: OTP-19818
  Related Id(s): PR-10296

- Make sure TLS-1.3 protocol spec is followed, that is psk-hello extension is
  guaranteed to be included as the last extension in the list of client hello
  extensions and internal hello message truncation in handshake history is
  handled correctly, the previous handling could cause interoperability issues.

# syntax_tools-3.2.2.2

The syntax_tools-3.2.2.2 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Annotate map comprehensions and generators

# xmerl-2.1.3.2

The xmerl-2.1.3.2 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- The XSD validation failed due to not handling the optional text blocks
  correctly in an XSD complex type with attribute `mixed=true`.
