  OTP-15523    Application(s): ftp
               Related Id(s): OTP-15352, PR-1968

               Add support for FTPES (explicit FTP over TLS).


  OTP-16611    Application(s): kernel
               Related Id(s): OTP-16749

               A compatibility adaptor for gen_tcp to use the new
               socket API has been implemented (gen_tcp_socket). Used
               when setting the kernel application variable
               inet_backend = socket.


  OTP-16686    Application(s): debugger, erts, kernel, stdlib

               Extended error information for failing BIF calls as
               proposed in EEP 54 has been implemented.

               When a BIF call from the Erlang shell fails, more
               information about which argument or arguments that were
               in error will be printed. The same extended error
               information will by proc_lib, common_test, and qlc when
               BIF calls fail.

               For applications that wish to provide the same extended
               error information, there are new functions
               erl_error:format_exception/3 and
               erl_error:format_exception/4.

               There is a new error/3 BIF that allows applications or
               libraries to provide extended error information in the
               same way for their own exceptions.


  OTP-16706    Application(s): compiler
               Related Id(s): ERL-1281

               Variables bound between the keywords 'try' and 'of' can
               now be used in the clauses following the 'of' keyword
               (that is, in the success case when no exception was
               raised).


  OTP-16718    Application(s): erts, kernel, stdlib
               Related Id(s): PR-2735

               Process aliases as outlined by EEP 53 has been
               introduced. Process aliases is introduced in order to
               provide a lightweight mechanism that can prevent late
               replies after timeout or connection loss. For more
               information, see EEP 53 and the documentation of the
               new alias/1 BIF and the new options to the monitor/3
               BIF.

               The call operation in the framework used by gen_server,
               gen_statem, and gen_event has been updated to utilize
               alias in order to prevent late responses. The
               gen_statem behavior still use a proxy process in the
               distributed case, since it has always prevented late
               replies and aliases wont work against pre OTP 24 nodes.
               The proxy process can be removed in OTP 26.

               The alias feature also made it possible to introduce
               new functions similar to the erpc:receive_response()
               function in the gen behaviors, so the new functions
               gen_server:receive_response(),
               gen_statem:receive_response(),
               gen_event:receive_response() have also been introduced.


  OTP-16800    Application(s): wx

               The application has been completely rewritten in order
               to use wxWidgets version 3 as its base.

               Add basic documentation generated from the wxWidgets
               project.


  OTP-16824    Application(s): compiler

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Compiler warnings and errors now include column numbers
               in addition to line numbers.

               When a compiler message is emitted, the source line is
               printed along with a marker (a ^ character) that
               indicates the column position of the issue. The option
               'brief' removes the printout of the source line.

               The compiler option {error_location, line | column} has
               been added. The default value is column. Besides adding
               column numbers to compilation warnings and errors, the
               option also determines whether column numbers are
               included in abstract code. If tools stop working,
               setting the environment variable ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS
               can help (include {error_location, line}).

               The compiler will now call the function
               PT:parse_transform_info/0 in parse transforms (if it
               exists). It can be used by parse transforms to signal
               that they can only handle line numbers in abstract
               code.


  OTP-16885    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): PR-2745

               The BeamAsm JIT-compiler has been added to Erlang/OTP.
               The JIT-compiler is enabled by default on most x86
               64-bit platforms that have a C++ compiler that can
               compile C++17. To verify that a JIT enabled emulator is
               running you can use erlang:system_info(emu_flavor).

               For more information see the internal documentation of
               BeamAsm in erts.


  OTP-16949    Application(s): edoc
               Related Id(s): OTP-17192, PR-2803

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               EDoc, the Erlang documentation engine, hits version 1.0
               with this release, which means a few changes.

               EDoc is now capable of emitting EEP-48 doc chunks. This
               means that, with some configuration, community projects
               can now provide documentation for shell_docs the same
               way that OTP libraries did since OTP 23.0.

               The @spec and @type EDoc tags have been deprecated.
               These are not supported with the new chunk-generating
               doclet and layout. Moreover, previously when there was
               a redundant @spec tag and -spec attribute defined for
               the same function, the @spec tag would take precedence.
               Now, the -spec attribute takes precedence and is more
               important. The same is true for redundant @type tags
               and -type attributes. Warnings are now emitted when
               such redundant entries are found.

               The ?NO_APP macro in edoc_doclet.hrl has been
               deprecated. Use the atom no_app instead.

               See the Doc chunks chapter in the Edoc User's Guide for
               more details.


  OTP-16964    Application(s): compiler

               Generators in list and binary comprehensions will now
               raise a {bad_generator,Generator} exception if the
               generator has an incorrect type (instead of raising an
               ad-hoc badarg or badarih exception). Similarly, when a
               filter does not evaluate to a boolean, a
               {bad_filter,Filter} exception will be raised. Some
               minor bugs in the compilation of binary comprehensions
               have also been fixed.


  OTP-16981    Application(s): compiler
               Related Id(s): ERL-1113

               Some compiler warnings, such as the warning for an
               expression whose result is ignored, could not be
               suppressed by assigning to a variable beginning with
               '_', but only by assigning to the anonymous variable
               ('_'). This has now been changed so that any warning
               that can be suppressed by assigning to the anonymous
               variable can also be suppressed by assigning to a
               variable beginning with '_'.

  OTP-15107    Application(s): stdlib
               Related Id(s): ERL-1381, PR-2813

               Time-outs in gen_statem with relative time 0 did not
               behave quite according to the intended model. This has
               now been corrected.

               The correction introduces a small potential
               incompatibility e.g when combining a state time-out
               with inserted events, and the inserted event does a
               state change in the state with the time-out. Before
               this correction the state time-out could be delivered
               even after the second state change, but now it is
               guaranteed that a state time-out is only delivered in
               the state it was started for, even in this corner case.


  OTP-16560    Application(s): megaco

               All the pre-v3 codec(s) (prev3a, prev3b and prev3c) was
               deprecated in OTP-23.0. They have now been removed.


  OTP-16656    Application(s): crypto

               The functions and cipher names that were deprecated in
               OTP-23.0 are now removed.


  OTP-16749    Application(s): erts, kernel
               Related Id(s): OTP-14601

               The experimental new socket API has been further
               developed. Some backwards incompatible changes with
               respect to OTP 23 have been made.

               The control message format has been changed so a
               decoded value is now in the 'value' field instead of in
               the 'data' field. The 'data' field now always contains
               binary data.

               Some type names have been changed regarding message
               headers and control message headers.

               socket:bind/2 now returns plain ok instead of {ok,
               Port} which was only relevant for the inet and inet6
               address families and often not interesting. To find out
               which port was chosen use socket:sockname/1.

               Compiler warnings and errors now include column numbers
               in addition to line numbers.

               When a compiler message is emitted, the source line is
               printed along with a marker (a ^ character) that
               indicates the column position of the issue. The option
               'brief' removes the printout of the source line.

               The compiler option {error_location, line | column} has
               been added. The default value is column. Besides adding
               column numbers to compilation warnings and errors, the

               included in abstract code. If tools stop working,

               EDoc, the Erlang documentation engine, hits version 1.0
               with this release, which means a few changes.

               EDoc is now capable of emitting EEP-48 doc chunks. This
               means that, with some configuration, community projects
               can now provide documentation for shell_docs the same
               way that OTP libraries did since OTP 23.0.

               The @spec and @type EDoc tags have been deprecated.
               These are not supported with the new chunk-generating
               doclet and layout. Moreover, previously when there was
               a redundant @spec tag and -spec attribute defined for
               the same function, the @spec tag would take precedence.
               Now, the -spec attribute takes precedence and is more
               important. The same is true for redundant @type tags
               and -type attributes. Warnings are now emitted when
               such redundant entries are found.

               The ?NO_APP macro in edoc_doclet.hrl has been
               deprecated. Use the atom no_app instead.

               See the Doc chunks chapter in the Edoc User's Guide for
               more details.

               Related Id(s): PR-2989

               The behaviour for gen_tcp:connect/3,4 has been changed
               to not per default bind to an address, which allows the
               network stack to delay the address and port selection
               to when the remote address is known. This allows better
               port re-use, and thus enables far more outgoing
               connections, since the ephemeral port range no longer
               has to be a hard limit.

               There is a theoretical possibility that this behaviour
               change can affect the set of possible error values, or
               have other small implications on some platforms.

               The RSA SHA1 sign/verify variants are disabled by
               default. That is, ssh-rsa is disabled by default as
               well as the SHA1 sign/verify with RSA keys from id_rsa
               and ssh_host_rsa_key. All SHA2 sign/verify are enabled
               by default.

               The reason is that SHA1 is now considered easy to

               EDoc, the Erlang documentation engine, hits version 1.0
               with this release, which means a few changes.

               EDoc is now capable of emitting EEP-48 doc chunks. This
               means that, with some configuration, community projects
               can now provide documentation for shell_docs the same
               way that OTP libraries did since OTP 23.0.

               The @spec and @type EDoc tags have been deprecated.
               These are not supported with the new chunk-generating
               doclet and layout. Moreover, previously when there was
               a redundant @spec tag and -spec attribute defined for
               the same function, the @spec tag would take precedence.
               Now, the -spec attribute takes precedence and is more
               important. The same is true for redundant @type tags
               and -type attributes. Warnings are now emitted when
               such redundant entries are found.

               The ?NO_APP macro in edoc_doclet.hrl has been
               deprecated. Use the atom no_app instead.

               See the Doc chunks chapter in the Edoc User's Guide for
               more details.

               Process aliases as outlined by EEP 53 has been
               introduced. Process aliases is introduced in order to
               provide a lightweight mechanism that can prevent late
               replies after timeout or connection loss. For more
               information, see EEP 53 and the documentation of the
               new alias/1 BIF and the new options to the monitor/3
               BIF.

               The call operation in the framework used by gen_server,
               gen_statem, and gen_event has been updated to utilize
               alias in order to prevent late responses. The
               gen_statem behavior still use a proxy process in the
               distributed case, since it has always prevented late
               replies and aliases wont work against pre OTP 24 nodes.
               The proxy process can be removed in OTP 26.

               The alias feature also made it possible to introduce
               new functions similar to the erpc:receive_response()
               function in the gen behaviors, so the new functions
               gen_server:receive_response(),
               gen_statem:receive_response(),
               gen_event:receive_response() have also been introduced.

               The experimental new socket API has been further
               developed. Some backwards incompatible changes with
               respect to OTP 23 have been made.

               The control message format has been changed so a
               decoded value is now in the 'value' field instead of in
               the 'data' field. The 'data' field now always contains
               binary data.

               Some type names have been changed regarding message
               headers and control message headers.

               socket:bind/2 now returns plain ok instead of {ok,
               Port} which was only relevant for the inet and inet6
               address families and often not interesting. To find out
               which port was chosen use socket:sockname/1.

               By default all ERTS internal memory allocators based on
               alloc_util will now use their own separate carrier pool
               for migration of carriers instead of using a node
               global carrier pool. This was the default behavior
               between OTP 17 and OTP 21, but changed to use a node
               global carrier pool as of OTP 22.0. Usage of the node
               global carrier pool proved troublesome since it had a
               tendency to spread long lived blocks into allocators
               with normally short lived blocks causing increased
               memory fragmentation. The node global carrier pool
               behavior as well as other behaviors can be configured
               using the +M<S>cp command line argument.

               filtermap/2, from_keys/2, and maps:foreach/2.

               maps:merge_with/3 is the same as merge/2 but takes an
               extra fun that is used to combine items with the same
               key.

               maps:intersect/2 computes the intersection of two maps.

               maps:intersect_with/3 is the same as intersect/2 but
               takes an extra fun that is used to combine intersecting
               items.

               maps:filtermap/2 allows filtering and mapping of a map
               in a single pass.

               maps:from_keys/2 constructs a map from a list of keys
               and a single value and can be used to to optimize sets
               operations such as from_list/1, filter/2,
               intersection/2, and subtract/2.

               maps:foreach/2 allows iteration over a map without

               Extended error information for failing BIF calls as
               proposed in EEP 54 has been implemented.

               When a BIF call from the Erlang shell fails, more
               information about which argument or arguments that were
               in error will be printed. The same extended error
               information will by proc_lib, common_test, and qlc when
               BIF calls fail.

               For applications that wish to provide the same extended
               error information, there are new functions
               erl_error:format_exception/3 and
               erl_error:format_exception/4.

               There is a new error/3 BIF that allows applications or
               libraries to provide extended error information in the
               same way for their own exceptions.

               *** HIGHLIGHT ***

               Process aliases as outlined by EEP 53 has been
               introduced. Process aliases is introduced in order to
               provide a lightweight mechanism that can prevent late
               replies after timeout or connection loss. For more
               information, see EEP 53 and the documentation of the
               new alias/1 BIF and the new options to the monitor/3
               BIF.

               The call operation in the framework used by gen_server,
               gen_statem, and gen_event has been updated to utilize
               alias in order to prevent late responses. The
               gen_statem behavior still use a proxy process in the
               distributed case, since it has always prevented late
               replies and aliases wont work against pre OTP 24 nodes.
               The proxy process can be removed in OTP 26.

               The alias feature also made it possible to introduce
               new functions similar to the erpc:receive_response()
               function in the gen behaviors, so the new functions
               gen_server:receive_response(),
               gen_statem:receive_response(),
               gen_event:receive_response() have also been introduced.

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The experimental new socket API has been further
               developed. Some backwards incompatible changes with
               respect to OTP 23 have been made.

               The control message format has been changed so a
               decoded value is now in the 'value' field instead of in
               the 'data' field. The 'data' field now always contains
               binary data.

               Some type names have been changed regarding message
               headers and control message headers.

               socket:bind/2 now returns plain ok instead of {ok,
               Port} which was only relevant for the inet and inet6
               address families and often not interesting. To find out
               which port was chosen use socket:sockname/1.

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The behaviour for gen_tcp:connect/3,4 has been changed
               to not per default bind to an address, which allows the
               network stack to delay the address and port selection
               to when the remote address is known. This allows better
               port re-use, and thus enables far more outgoing
               connections, since the ephemeral port range no longer
               has to be a hard limit.

               There is a theoretical possibility that this behaviour
               change can affect the set of possible error values, or
               have other small implications on some platforms.

               Time-outs in gen_statem with relative time 0 did not
               behave quite according to the intended model. This has
               now been corrected.

               The correction introduces a small potential
               incompatibility e.g when combining a state time-out
               with inserted events, and the inserted event does a
               state change in the state with the time-out. Before
               this correction the state time-out could be delivered
               even after the second state change, but now it is
               guaranteed that a state time-out is only delivered in
               the state it was started for, even in this corner case.

               Process aliases as outlined by EEP 53 has been

               provide a lightweight mechanism that can prevent late
               replies after timeout or connection loss. For more
               information, see EEP 53 and the documentation of the
               new alias/1 BIF and the new options to the monitor/3
               BIF.

               The call operation in the framework used by gen_server,
               gen_statem, and gen_event has been updated to utilize
               alias in order to prevent late responses. The
               gen_statem behavior still use a proxy process in the
               distributed case, since it has always prevented late
               replies and aliases wont work against pre OTP 24 nodes.
               The proxy process can be removed in OTP 26.

               The alias feature also made it possible to introduce
               new functions similar to the erpc:receive_response()
               function in the gen behaviors, so the new functions

               maps:intersect/2 computes the intersection of two maps.

               maps:intersect_with/3 is the same as intersect/2 but

               items.

               maps:filtermap/2 allows filtering and mapping of a map
               in a single pass.

               maps:from_keys/2 constructs a map from a list of keys
               and a single value and can be used to to optimize sets
               operations such as from_list/1, filter/2,
               intersection/2, and subtract/2.

               For cover-compiled code, the error behaviour of list
               and binary comprehensions that used andalso/orelse in
               guards could be changed so that a filter that was
               supposed be evaluated in guard context was evaluated in
               body context. That is, there was a possibility that
               comprehensions that did not raise exceptions could
               raise exceptions when being run using cover.
