requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# erts-15.2.7

The erts-15.2.7 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

# kernel-10.2.7

Note! The kernel-10.2.7 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-15.2.5 (first satisfied in OTP 27.3.2)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change, disk_log will not crash when using chunk_step/3 after log
  size was decreased.

  Own Id: OTP-19605
  Related Id(s): GH-9720, PR-9765

- With this change, disk_log will not run into infinite loop when using
  chunk/2,3 after log size was decreased.

# ssh-5.2.11

The ssh-5.2.11 application can be applied independently of other applications on
a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Fix KEX strict implementation according to draft-miller-sshm-strict-kex-01
  document.

  Own Id: OTP-19625
  Related Id(s): CVE-2025-46712

> stdlib-5.0, stdlib-6.0

# xmerl-2.1.3

The xmerl-2.1.3 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Improvements and New Features

- A new option to discard whitespace before the `xml` tag when reading from a
  stream has been added to the Xmerl SAX parser.

  - **`{discard_ws_before_xml_document, Boolean}`** - Discard whitespace before
    `xml` tag instead of returning a fatal error if set to `true` (`false` is
    default)
