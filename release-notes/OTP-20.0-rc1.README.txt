  OTP-10289    Application(s): stdlib
               Related Id(s): OTP-10309

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Improved unicode support for strings. Added
               normalization functions in the unicode module. Extended
               the string module API with new functions with improved
               unicode handling and that works on grapheme clusters.
               The new functions operates on the unicode:chardata()
               type, thus they also accept UTF-8 binaries as input.

               The old string API have been marked as obsolete. The
               return values have been changed for some error cases.


  OTP-13820    Application(s): ssl

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               TLS-1.2 clients will now always send hello messages on
               its own format, as opposed to earlier versions that
               will send the hello on the lowest supported version,
               this is a change supported by the latest RFC.

               This will make interoperability with some newer servers
               smoother. Potentially, but unlikely, this could cause a
               problem with older servers if they do not adhere to the
               RFC and ignore unknown extensions.


  OTP-13900    Application(s): crypto

               The crypto application now supports OpenSSL 1.1.


  OTP-13921    Application(s): crypto, ssl
               Related Id(s): PR-1180

               Allow Erlang/OTP to use OpenSSL in FIPS-140 mode, in
               order to satisfy specific security requirements (mostly
               by different parts of the US federal government).

               See the new crypto users guide "FIPS mode" chapter
               about building and using the FIPS support which is
               disabled by default.

  OTP-14059    Application(s): kernel, stdlib

               Functions for detecting changed code has been added.
               code:modified_modules/0 returns all currently loaded
               modules that have changed on disk. code:module_status/1
               returns the status for a module. In the shell and in c
               module, mm/0 is short for code:modified_modules/0, and
               lm/0 reloads all currently loaded modules that have
               changed on disk.


  OTP-14094    Application(s): stdlib

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Optimized ETS operations by changing table identifier
               type from integer to reference. The reference enables a
               more direct mapping to the table with less potential
               lock contention and makes especially creation and
               deletion of tables scale much better.

               The change of the opaque type for the ETS table
               identifiers may cause failure in code that make faulty
               assumptions about this opaque type.


  OTP-14152    Application(s): erts

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Dirty schedulers are now enabled and supported on
               Erlang runtime systems with SMP support.

               Besides support for dirty NIFs also support for dirty
               BIFs and dirty garbage collection have been introduced.
               All garbage collections that potentially will take a
               long time to complete are now performed on dirty
               schedulers if enabled.

               erlang:statistics(scheduler_wall_time) now also
               includes information about dirty CPU schedulers. Code
               using erlang:statistics(scheduler_wall_time) may have
               to be rewritten to take this incompatibility into
               consideration.


  OTP-14178    Application(s): compiler, erts

               Atoms may now contain arbitrary Unicode characters.


  OTP-14183    Application(s): stdlib

               Replace gen_fsm with gen_statem


  OTP-14205    Application(s): erts

               All uses of the magic binary kludge has been replaced
               by uses of erlang references.

               A magic binary was presented as an empty binary, but
               actually referred other data internally in the Erlang
               VM. Since they were presented as empty binaries,
               different magic binaries compared as equal, and also
               lost their internal data when passed out of an erlang
               node.

               The new usage of references has not got any of these
               strange semantic issues, and the usage of these
               references has been optimized to give the same
               performance benefits as well as memory usage benefits
               as magic binaries had.

               A couple of examples of previous uses of magic binaries
               are match specifications and NIF resources.


  OTP-14219    Application(s): asn1

               The new 'maps' option changes the representation of the
               types SEQUENCE and SET to be maps (instead of records).


  OTP-14226    Application(s): stdlib

               erl_tar in previous versions of OTP only supports the
               USTAR format. That limited path names to at most 255
               bytes, and did not support Unicode characters in names
               in a portable way.

               erl_tar now has support for reading tar archives in the
               formats currently in common use, such as v7, STAR,
               USTAR, PAX, and GNU tar's extensions to the STAR/USTAR
               format. When writing tar archives, erl_tar can now
               write them in the PAX format if necessary (for example,
               to support very long filenames or filenames with
               Unicode characters). If possible, erl_tar will still
               write tar archives in the USTAR for maximum
               portability.


  OTP-14291    Application(s): ssl

               Extend connection_information/[1,2] . The values
               session_id, master_secret, client_random and
               server_random can no be accessed by
               connection_information/2. Note only session_id will be
               added to connection_information/1. The rational is that
               values concerning the connection security should have
               to be explicitly requested.


  OTP-14319    Application(s): stdlib
               Related Id(s): PR-1076

               Add new function ets:select_replace/2 which performs
               atomic "compare-and-swap" operations for ETS objects
               using match specifications.

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version
               8.33 to version 8.40. This library is used for
               implementation of the re regular expressions module.

               Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for
               better stack protection. In order to utilize this
               feature, the stack size of normal scheduler threads is
               now by default set to 128 kilo words on all platforms.
               The stack size of normal scheduler threads can be set
               upon system start by passing the +sss command line
               argument to the erl command.

               See http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt for
               information about changes made to PCRE between the
               versions 8.33 and 8.40.


  OTP-14388    Application(s): ssl

               Basic support for DTLS that been tested together with
               OpenSSL.

               Test by providing the option {protocol, dtls} to the
               ssl API functions connect and listen.

  OTP-12872    Application(s): ssh

               The internal handling of SSH options is re-written.

               Previously there were no checks if a client option was
               given to a daemon or vice versa. This is corrected now.
               If your code has e.g. a client-only option in a call to
               start a daemon, the call will fail.


  OTP-13703    Application(s): otp

               The 'gs' application has been removed.


  OTP-13820    Application(s): ssl

               Related Id(s): OTP-13833

               The previously used purge strategy has been removed.
               The optional purge strategy introduced in ERTS version
               8.1 is now the only strategy available.

               The new purge strategy is slightly incompatible with
               the old strategy. Previously processes holding funs
               that referred to the module being purged either failed
               a soft purge, or was killed during a hard purge. The
               new strategy completely ignores funs. If funs referring
               to the code being purged exist, and are used after a
               purge, an exception will be raised upon usage. That is,
               the behavior will be exactly the same as the case when
               a fun is received by a process after the purge.

               For more information see the documentation of
               erlang:check_process_code/3.


  OTP-13873    Application(s): crypto

               Removed functions deprecated in crypto-3.0 first

  OTP-13908    Application(s): erts

               The NIF library reload feature is not supported
               anymore. It has been marked as deprecated since OTP
               R15B. This means that you are only allowed to do one
               successful call to erlang:load_nif/2 for each module
               instance. A second call to erlang:load_nif/2 will
               return {error, {reload, _}} even if the NIF library
               imlements the reload callback.

               Runtime upgrade of a NIF library is still supported by
               using the Erlang module upgrade mechanics with a
               current and an old module instance existing at the same
               time with their corresponding NIF libraries.


  OTP-14039    Application(s): mnesia

               Removed the wrapping of select continuations in
               extension plugin handling. This might require the user

  OTP-14110    Application(s): ssh

               Modernization of diffie-hellman algorithms. Removed an
               outdated weak algorithm and added stronger replacements
               to keep interoperability with other ssh clients and
               servers. The default ordering is also adjusted.

               Retired: key-exchange diffie-hellman-group1-sha1. It is
               not enabled by default, but can be enabled with the
               option preferred-algorithms.

               Added: key-exchange diffie-hellman-group16-sha512,

  OTP-13690    Application(s): compiler, stdlib

               For many releases, it has been legal to override a BIF
               with a local function having the same name. However,
               calling a local function with the same name as guard
               BIF as filter in a list comprehension was not allowed.

  OTP-13856    Application(s): compiler

               The undocumented and unsupported module sys_pre_expand
               has been removed. As a partical replacement for the
               functionality, there is a new function
               erl_internal:add_predefined_functions/1 and
               erl_expand_records will now add a module prefix to

               The format of debug information that is stored in BEAM

               information using beam_lib:chunk(Beam, [abstract_code])
               will continue to work with both the new and old format.
               Tools that call beam_lib:chunk(Beam, ["Abst"]) will not

               The previously used purge strategy has been removed.
               The optional purge strategy introduced in ERTS version
               8.1 is now the only strategy available.

               The new purge strategy is slightly incompatible with
               the old strategy. Previously processes holding funs
               that referred to the module being purged either failed
               a soft purge, or was killed during a hard purge. The
               new strategy completely ignores funs. If funs referring
               to the code being purged exist, and are used after a
               purge, an exception will be raised upon usage. That is,

               The NIF library reload feature is not supported
               anymore. It has been marked as deprecated since OTP
               R15B. This means that you are only allowed to do one
               successful call to erlang:load_nif/2 for each module

               return {error, {reload, _}} even if the NIF library
               imlements the reload callback.

               Runtime upgrade of a NIF library is still supported by

               All uses of the magic binary kludge has been replaced
               by uses of erlang references.

               A magic binary was presented as an empty binary, but
               actually referred other data internally in the Erlang
               VM. Since they were presented as empty binaries,
               different magic binaries compared as equal, and also
               lost their internal data when passed out of an erlang
               node.

               The new usage of references has not got any of these
               strange semantic issues, and the usage of these
               references has been optimized to give the same
               performance benefits as well as memory usage benefits
               as magic binaries had.

               A couple of examples of previous uses of magic binaries

               Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version
               8.33 to version 8.40. This library is used for
               implementation of the re regular expressions module.

               Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for
               better stack protection. In order to utilize this
               feature, the stack size of normal scheduler threads is
               now by default set to 128 kilo words on all platforms.
               The stack size of normal scheduler threads can be set
               upon system start by passing the +sss command line
               argument to the erl command.

               See http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt for

  OTP-12872    Application(s): ssh

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The internal handling of SSH options is re-written.

               Previously there were no checks if a client option was
               given to a daemon or vice versa. This is corrected now.
               If your code has e.g. a client-only option in a call to
               start a daemon, the call will fail.


  OTP-14110    Application(s): ssh

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Modernization of diffie-hellman algorithms. Removed an
               outdated weak algorithm and added stronger replacements
               to keep interoperability with other ssh clients and
               servers. The default ordering is also adjusted.

               Retired: key-exchange diffie-hellman-group1-sha1. It is
               not enabled by default, but can be enabled with the
               option preferred-algorithms.

               Added: key-exchange diffie-hellman-group16-sha512,
               diffie-hellman-group18-sha512 and
               diffie-hellman-group14-sha256.

               The draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-ext-info-05 and
               draft-ietf-curdle-rsa-sha2-05 are (partially)
               implemented.

               The extension server-sig-algs and the signature
               algorithms rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512 are
               implemented. The rsa-sha2-* are not enabled by default
               yet since they has a bug. Use option
               preferred_algorithms with key public key to try them.


  OTP-14243    Application(s): ssh

               Ssh:connect, ssh:shell and ssh:start_channel now accept

  OTP-14259    Application(s): ssh

               The function ssh:daemon_info/1 now returns Host and
               Profile as well as the Port info.


  OTP-14263    Application(s): ssh

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Removed the option public_key_alg which was deprecated
               in 18.2. Use pref_public_key_algs instead.


  OTP-14264    Application(s): ssh

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The ssh application is refactored regarding daemon
               starting. The resolution of contradicting Host argument
               and ip option were not described. There were also
               strange corner cases when the 'any' value was used in
               Host argument or ip option. This is (hopefully)
               resolved now, but it may cause incompatibilities for
               code using both Host and the ip option. The value
               'loopback' has been added for a correct way of naming
               those addresses.


  OTP-14267    Application(s): ssh
               Related Id(s): OTP-14266

               The supervisor code is refactored. The naming of
               listening IP-Port-Profile tripples are slightly changed
               to improve consistency in strange corner cases as
               resolved by OTP-14264


  OTP-14312    Application(s): ssh

               *** HIGHLIGHT ***

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               TLS-1.2 clients will now always send hello messages on
               its own format, as opposed to earlier versions that
               will send the hello on the lowest supported version,
               this is a change supported by the latest RFC.

               This will make interoperability with some newer servers
               smoother. Potentially, but unlikely, this could cause a
               problem with older servers if they do not adhere to the
               RFC and ignore unknown extensions.

               connection_information/2. Note only session_id will be
               added to connection_information/1. The rational is that
               values concerning the connection security should have
               to be explicitly requested.

               For many releases, it has been legal to override a BIF
               with a local function having the same name. However,
               calling a local function with the same name as guard
               BIF as filter in a list comprehension was not allowed.

               A new (default) pseudo-random number generator
               algorithm Xoroshiro116+ has been implemented in the
               rand module.

               The old algorithm implementations had a number of flaws
               so they are all deprecated, but corrected versions of
               two of them have been added. See the documentation.


  OTP-14296    Application(s): debugger, stdlib

               The Erlang shell, qlc:string_to_handle(), and the
               Debugger (the Evaluator area and Edit variable window
               of the Bindings area) can parse pids, ports,
               references, and external funs, as long as they can be
               created in the running system.


  OTP-14531    Application(s): stdlib

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The state machine engine gen_statem can now handle
               generic time-outs (multiple named) as well as absolute
               time-out time. See the documentation.

               The gen_statem callback Module:init/1 has become
               mandatory to harmonize with other gen_* modules. This
               may be an incompatibility for gen_statem callback
               modules that use gen_statem:enter_loop/4-6.

               Improved unicode support for strings. Added
               normalization functions in the unicode module. Extended
               the string module API with new functions with improved
               unicode handling and that works on grapheme clusters.
               The new functions operates on the unicode:chardata()
               type, thus they also accept UTF-8 binaries as input.

               The old string API have been marked as obsolete. The
               return values have been changed for some error cases.

               There are two new guard BIFs 'floor/1' and 'ceil/1'.
               They both return integers. In the 'math' module, there

  OTP-14001    Application(s): stdlib

               The EXIT signals received from processes using proc_lib
               now looks like EXIT signals from processes that were
               spawned using spawn_link. In particular, that means
               that the stack trace is now included in the EXIT signal
               so that it can see where the process crashed.


  OTP-14035    Application(s): stdlib

               sets:add_element/2 is faster when adding an element
               that is already present, and sets:del_element/2 is
               faster when the element to be deleted is not present.
               This optimization can make certain operations, such as
               sets:union/2 with many overlapping elements, up to two
               orders of magnitude faster.

  OTP-14066    Application(s): stdlib

               Each assert macro in assert.hrl now has a corresponding
               version with an extra argument, for adding comments to
               assertions. These can for example be printed as part of
               error reports, to clarify the meaning of the check that

  OTP-14068    Application(s): stdlib

               error_logger_tty_h and error_logger_file_h now inserts
               the node information for nonlocal messages before the

               Optimized ETS operations by changing table identifier
               type from integer to reference. The reference enables a
               more direct mapping to the table with less potential
               lock contention and makes especially creation and
               deletion of tables scale much better.

               The change of the opaque type for the ETS table
               identifiers may cause failure in code that make faulty

               erl_tar in previous versions of OTP only supports the

               in a portable way.

               erl_tar now has support for reading tar archives in the
               formats currently in common use, such as v7, STAR,
               USTAR, PAX, and GNU tar's extensions to the STAR/USTAR

               to support very long filenames or filenames with
               Unicode characters). If possible, erl_tar will still

               Two new functions has been implemented in the rand
               module; normal/2 and normal_s/3, that both produce
               normal distribution (pseudo) random numbers with mean
               value and variance according to arguments.

               *** HIGHLIGHT ***

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version
               8.33 to version 8.40. This library is used for
               implementation of the re regular expressions module.

               Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for
               better stack protection. In order to utilize this
               feature, the stack size of normal scheduler threads is
               now by default set to 128 kilo words on all platforms.
               The stack size of normal scheduler threads can be set
               upon system start by passing the +sss command line
               argument to the erl command.

               See http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt for
               information about changes made to PCRE between the
               versions 8.33 and 8.40.

               Added function re:version/0 which returns information
               about the OTP internal PCRE version used for
               implementation of the re module.

               Related Id(s): PR-1367

               The format of debug information that is stored in BEAM
               files (when debug_info is used) has been changed. The
               purpose of the change is to better support other
               BEAM-based languages such as Elixir or LFE.

               All tools included in OTP (dialyzer, debugger, cover,
               and so on) will handle both the new format and the
               previous format. Tools that retrieve the debug
               information using beam_lib:chunk(Beam, [abstract_code])
               will continue to work with both the new and old format.
               Tools that call beam_lib:chunk(Beam, ["Abst"]) will not
               work with the new format.

               For more information, see the description of debug_info
               in the documentation for beam_lib and the description
               of the {debug_info,{Backend,Data}} option in the
               documentation for compile.
