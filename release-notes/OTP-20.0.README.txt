  OTP-10289    Application(s): stdlib
               Related Id(s): OTP-10309

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Improved unicode support for strings. Added
               normalization functions in the unicode module. Extended
               the string module API with new functions with improved
               unicode handling and that works on grapheme clusters.
               The new functions operates on the unicode:chardata()
               type, thus they also accept UTF-8 binaries as input.

               The old string API have been marked as obsolete. The
               return values have been changed for some error cases.


  OTP-13820    Application(s): ssl

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               TLS-1.2 clients will now always send hello messages on
               its own format, as opposed to earlier versions that
               will send the hello on the lowest supported version,
               this is a change supported by the latest RFC.

               This will make interoperability with some newer servers
               smoother. Potentially, but unlikely, this could cause a
               problem with older servers if they do not adhere to the
               RFC and ignore unknown extensions.


  OTP-13900    Application(s): crypto

               The crypto application now supports OpenSSL 1.1.


  OTP-13921    Application(s): crypto, ssl
               Related Id(s): PR-1180

               Allow Erlang/OTP to use OpenSSL in FIPS-140 mode, in
               order to satisfy specific security requirements (mostly
               by different parts of the US federal government).

               See the new crypto users guide "FIPS mode" chapter
               about building and using the FIPS support which is
               disabled by default.

  OTP-14059    Application(s): kernel, stdlib

               Functions for detecting changed code has been added.
               code:modified_modules/0 returns all currently loaded
               modules that have changed on disk. code:module_status/1
               returns the status for a module. In the shell and in c
               module, mm/0 is short for code:modified_modules/0, and
               lm/0 reloads all currently loaded modules that have
               changed on disk.


  OTP-14094    Application(s): stdlib

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Optimized ETS operations by changing table identifier
               type from integer to reference. The reference enables a
               more direct mapping to the table with less potential
               lock contention and makes especially creation and
               deletion of tables scale much better.

               The change of the opaque type for the ETS table
               identifiers may cause failure in code that make faulty
               assumptions about this opaque type.

               The number of tables stored at one Erlang node *used*
               to be limited. This is no longer the case (except by
               memory usage). The previous default limit was about
               1400 tables and could be increased by setting the
               environment variable ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES before starting
               the Erlang runtime system. This hard limit has been
               removed, but it is currently useful to set the
               ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES anyway. It should be set to an
               approximate of the maximum amount of tables used. This
               since an internal table for named tables is sized using
               this value. If large amounts of named tables are used
               and ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES hasn't been increased, the
               performance of named table lookup will degrade.


  OTP-14110    Application(s): ssh

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Modernization of key exchange algorithms. See
               draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-kex-sha2 for a discussion.

               Removed an outdated weak algorithm and added stronger
               replacements to keep interoperability with other modern
               ssh clients and servers. The default ordering of the
               algorithms is also adjusted.

               Retired: The nowadays unsecure key-exchange
               diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 is not enabled by default,
               but can be enabled with the option
               preferred-algorithms.

               Added: The new stronger key-exchange
               diffie-hellman-group16-sha512,
               diffie-hellman-group18-sha512 and
               diffie-hellman-group14-sha256 are added and enabled by
               default.

               The questionable [RFC 6194] sha1-based algorithms
               diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1 and
               diffie-hellman-group14-sha1 are however still kept
               enabled by default for compatibility with ancient
               clients and servers that lack modern key-exchange
               alternatives. When the draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-kex-sha2
               becomes an rfc, those sha1-based algorithms and
               diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 will be deprecated by IETF.
               They might then be removed from the default list in
               Erlang/OTP.


  OTP-14152    Application(s): erts

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Dirty schedulers are now enabled and supported on
               Erlang runtime systems with SMP support.

               Besides support for dirty NIFs also support for dirty
               BIFs and dirty garbage collection have been introduced.
               All garbage collections that potentially will take a
               long time to complete are now performed on dirty
               schedulers if enabled.

               erlang:statistics/1 with arguments inspecting scheduler
               and run queue states have been changed due to the dirty
               scheduler support. Code using this functionality may
               have to be rewritten taking these incompatibilities
               into consideration. Examples of such uses are calls to
               erlang:statistics(scheduler_wall_time),
               statistics(total_run_queue_lengths),
               statistics(total_active_tasks), etc.


  OTP-14178    Application(s): compiler, erts

               Atoms may now contain arbitrary Unicode characters.


  OTP-14183    Application(s): stdlib

               gen_fsm is deprecated and is replaced by gen_statem,
               however for backwards compatibility reasons gen_fsm may
               continue to exist as an undocumented feature for quite
               some time.


  OTP-14193    Application(s): ssh

               The Extension Negotiation Mechanism and the extension
               server-sig-algs in draft-ietf-curdle-ssh-ext-info-05
               are implemented.

               The related draft-ietf-curdle-rsa-sha2-05 is
               implemented and introduces the signature algorithms
               rsa-sha2-256 and rsa-sha2-512.


  OTP-14197    Application(s): ssl

               TLS client processes will by default call
               public_key:pkix_verify_hostname/2 to verify the
               hostname of the connection with the server certificates
               specified hostname during certificate path validation.
               The user may explicitly disables it. Also if the
               hostname can not be derived from the first argument to
               connect or is not supplied by the server name
               indication option, the check will not be performed.


  OTP-14205    Application(s): erts

               All uses of the magic binary kludge has been replaced
               by uses of erlang references.

               A magic binary was presented as an empty binary, but
               actually referred other data internally in the Erlang
               VM. Since they were presented as empty binaries,
               different magic binaries compared as equal, and also
               lost their internal data when passed out of an erlang
               node.

               The new usage of references has not got any of these
               strange semantic issues, and the usage of these
               references has been optimized to give the same
               performance benefits as well as memory usage benefits
               as magic binaries had.

               A couple of examples of previous uses of magic binaries
               are match specifications and NIF resources.


  OTP-14219    Application(s): asn1

               The new 'maps' option changes the representation of the
               types SEQUENCE and SET to be maps (instead of records).


  OTP-14226    Application(s): stdlib

               erl_tar in previous versions of OTP only supports the
               USTAR format. That limited path names to at most 255
               bytes, and did not support Unicode characters in names
               in a portable way.

               erl_tar now has support for reading tar archives in the
               formats currently in common use, such as v7, STAR,
               USTAR, PAX, and GNU tar's extensions to the STAR/USTAR
               format. When writing tar archives, erl_tar can now
               write them in the PAX format if necessary (for example,
               to support very long filenames or filenames with
               Unicode characters). If possible, erl_tar will still
               write tar archives in the USTAR for maximum
               portability.


  OTP-14291    Application(s): ssl

               Extend connection_information/[1,2] . The values
               session_id, master_secret, client_random and

               The optional purge strategy introduced in ERTS version
               8.1 is now the only strategy available.

               The new purge strategy is slightly incompatible with
               the old strategy. Previously processes holding funs
               that referred to the module being purged either failed
               a soft purge, or was killed during a hard purge. The
               new strategy completely ignores funs. If funs referring
               to the code being purged exist, and are used after a
               purge, an exception will be raised upon usage. That is,
               the behavior will be exactly the same as the case when

               *** HIGHLIGHT ***

               Optimized ETS operations by changing table identifier
               type from integer to reference. The reference enables a
               more direct mapping to the table with less potential
               lock contention and makes especially creation and
               deletion of tables scale much better.

               The change of the opaque type for the ETS table
               identifiers may cause failure in code that make faulty
               assumptions about this opaque type.

               The number of tables stored at one Erlang node *used*
               to be limited. This is no longer the case (except by
               memory usage). The previous default limit was about
               1400 tables and could be increased by setting the
               environment variable ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES before starting
               the Erlang runtime system. This hard limit has been
               removed, but it is currently useful to set the
               ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES anyway. It should be set to an
               approximate of the maximum amount of tables used. This
               since an internal table for named tables is sized using
               this value. If large amounts of named tables are used
               and ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES hasn't been increased, the
               performance of named table lookup will degrade.

               with a local function having the same name. However,
               calling a local function with the same name as guard
               BIF as filter in a list comprehension was not allowed.

               compile:forms/2 would not return the module name as
               documented when one of the options 'from_core',
               'from_asm', or 'from_beam' was given. Also, the
               compiler would crash if one of those options was
               combined with 'native'.

               A map expression such as,

               #{'a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'a' => 3}.

               will produce a warning for the repeated key 'a'.

               The format of debug information that is stored in BEAM
               files (when debug_info is used) has been changed. The
               purpose of the change is to better support other
               BEAM-based languages such as Elixir or LFE.

               All tools included in OTP (dialyzer, debugger, cover,
               and so on) will handle both the new format and the
               previous format. Tools that retrieve the debug
               information using beam_lib:chunk(Beam, [abstract_code])
               will continue to work with both the new and old format.
               Tools that call beam_lib:chunk(Beam, ["Abst"]) will not
               work with the new format.

               For more information, see the description of debug_info
               in the documentation for beam_lib and the description
               of the {debug_info,{Backend,Data}} option in the

  OTP-14401    Application(s): compiler

               In a future release, erlang:get_stacktrace/0 will
               probably only work when called from within a 'try'
               expression (otherwise it will return [].

               To help prepare for that change, the compiler will now
               by default warn if 'get_stacktrace/0' is used in a way
               that will not work in the future. Note that the warning
               will not be issued if 'get_stacktrace/0' is used in a
               function that uses neither 'catch' nor 'try' (because
               that could be a legal use if the function is called
               from within a 'try'.

               application in question.

               RFC 6733 2.4 requires a node to send the application
               identifiers of all locally supported applications at
               capabilities exchange, but not all nodes respect this

               Both diameter_tcp and diameter_sctp now accept two new
               configuration options: sender and message_cb. The
               former causes outgoing sends to take place in a
               dedicated process, to avoid the possibility of deadlock
               when both the transport process and its peer block in
               send. The latter allows a callback to control the
               reading of messages on the socket, to allow for
               backpressure towards peers when the rate of incoming
               traffic is greater than can otherwise be handled.

               Neither of these options are yet documented, but are
               unlikely to change unless problems are discovered. The
               sender option is not the default since it should
               probably always be used in combination with message_cb,
               to prevent incoming requests from being read at a
               higher rate than a peer allows outgoing answers to be
               sent.

               The optional purge strategy introduced in ERTS version
               8.1 is now the only strategy available.

               The new purge strategy is slightly incompatible with
               the old strategy. Previously processes holding funs
               that referred to the module being purged either failed
               a soft purge, or was killed during a hard purge. The
               new strategy completely ignores funs. If funs referring
               to the code being purged exist, and are used after a
               purge, an exception will be raised upon usage. That is,
               the behavior will be exactly the same as the case when
               a fun is received by a process after the purge.

               The NIF library reload feature is not supported
               anymore. It has been marked as deprecated since OTP

               All uses of the magic binary kludge has been replaced
               by uses of erlang references.

               A magic binary was presented as an empty binary, but
               actually referred other data internally in the Erlang
               VM. Since they were presented as empty binaries,
               different magic binaries compared as equal, and also
               lost their internal data when passed out of an erlang
               node.

               The new usage of references has not got any of these
               strange semantic issues, and the usage of these
               references has been optimized to give the same
               performance benefits as well as memory usage benefits
               as magic binaries had.

               A couple of examples of previous uses of magic binaries

               Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version
               8.33 to version 8.40. This library is used for
               implementation of the re regular expressions module.

               Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for
               better stack protection. In order to utilize this
               feature, the stack size of normal scheduler threads is
               now by default set to 128 kilo words on all platforms.
               The stack size of normal scheduler threads can be set

               Optimized ETS operations by changing table identifier
               type from integer to reference. The reference enables a
               more direct mapping to the table with less potential
               lock contention and makes especially creation and
               deletion of tables scale much better.

               The change of the opaque type for the ETS table
               identifiers may cause failure in code that make faulty
               assumptions about this opaque type.

               The number of tables stored at one Erlang node *used*
               to be limited. This is no longer the case (except by
               memory usage). The previous default limit was about
               1400 tables and could be increased by setting the
               environment variable ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES before starting
               the Erlang runtime system. This hard limit has been
               removed, but it is currently useful to set the
               ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES anyway. It should be set to an
               approximate of the maximum amount of tables used. This
               since an internal table for named tables is sized using
               this value. If large amounts of named tables are used
               and ERL_MAX_ETS_TABLES hasn't been increased, the
               performance of named table lookup will degrade.

               for directory traversal attacks; if a relative path
               points above the current working directory the
               extraction will be aborted.

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Upgraded the OTP internal PCRE library from version
               8.33 to version 8.40. This library is used for
               implementation of the re regular expressions module.

               Besides various bug fixes, the new version allows for
               better stack protection. In order to utilize this
               feature, the stack size of normal scheduler threads is
               now by default set to 128 kilo words on all platforms.
               The stack size of normal scheduler threads can be set
               upon system start by passing the +sss command line
               argument to the erl command.

               See http://pcre.org/original/changelog.txt for
               information about changes made to PCRE between the
               versions 8.33 and 8.40.

               Added function re:version/0 which returns information
               about the OTP internal PCRE version used for

  OTP-14369    Application(s): compiler, dialyzer, stdlib
               Related Id(s): PR-1367

               The format of debug information that is stored in BEAM
               files (when debug_info is used) has been changed. The
               purpose of the change is to better support other
               BEAM-based languages such as Elixir or LFE.

               All tools included in OTP (dialyzer, debugger, cover,
               and so on) will handle both the new format and the
               previous format. Tools that retrieve the debug
               information using beam_lib:chunk(Beam, [abstract_code])
               will continue to work with both the new and old format.
               Tools that call beam_lib:chunk(Beam, ["Abst"]) will not
               work with the new format.

               For more information, see the description of debug_info
               in the documentation for beam_lib and the description
               of the {debug_info,{Backend,Data}} option in the
               documentation for compile.


  OTP-14405    Application(s): stdlib

               Add option hibernate_after to gen_server, gen_statem
               and gen_event. Also added to the deprecated gen_fsm
               behaviour.


  OTP-14417    Application(s): kernel, stdlib

               The size of crash reports created by gen_server,
               gen_statem and proc_lib is limited with aid of the
               Kernel application variable error_logger_format_depth.
               The purpose is to limit the size of the messages sent
               to the error_logger process when processes with huge
               message queues or states crash.

               The crash report generated by proc_lib includes the new
               tag message_queue_len. The neighbour report also
               includes the new tag current_stacktrace. Finally, the
               neighbour report no longer includes the tags messages
               and dictionary.

               The new function error_logger:get_format_depth/0 can be
               used to retrieve the value of the Kernel application
               variable error_logger_format_depth.
