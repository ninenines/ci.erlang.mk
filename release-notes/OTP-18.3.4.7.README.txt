  OTP-14748    Application(s): ssl

               An erlang TLS server configured with cipher suites
               using rsa key exchange, may be vulnerable to an
               Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext attack (AKA Bleichenbacher
               attack) against RSA, which when exploited, may result
               in plaintext recovery of encrypted messages and/or a
               Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, despite the attacker
               not having gained access to the server’s private key
               itself. CVE-2017-1000385

               Exploiting this vulnerability to perform plaintext
               recovery of encrypted messages will, in most practical
               cases, allow an attacker to read the plaintext only
               after the session has completed. Only TLS sessions
               established using RSA key exchange are vulnerable to
               this attack.

               Exploiting this vulnerability to conduct a MiTM attack
               requires the attacker to complete the initial attack,
               which may require thousands of server requests, during
               the handshake phase of the targeted session within the
               window of the configured handshake timeout. This attack
               may be conducted against any TLS session using RSA
               signatures, but only if cipher suites using RSA key
               exchange are also enabled on the server. The limited
               window of opportunity, limitations in bandwidth, and
               latency make this attack significantly more difficult
               to execute.

               RSA key exchange is enabled by default although least
               prioritized if server order is honored. For such a
               cipher suite to be chosen it must also be supported by
               the client and probably the only shared cipher suite.

               Captured TLS sessions encrypted with ephemeral cipher
               suites (DHE or ECDHE) are not at risk for subsequent
               decryption due to this vulnerability.

               As a workaround if default cipher suite configuration
               was used you can configure the server to not use
               vulnerable suites with the ciphers option like this:

               {ciphers, [Suite || Suite <- ssl:cipher_suites(),
               element(1,Suite) =/= rsa]}

               that is your code will look somethingh like this:

               ssl:listen(Port, [{ciphers, [Suite || Suite <-
               ssl:cipher_suites(), element(1,S) =/= rsa]} |
               Options]).

               Thanks to Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky and Craig Young
               for reporting this vulnerability.
