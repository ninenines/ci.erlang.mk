Check out the git tag OTP-27.1.3, and build a full OTP system including
documentation. Apply one or more applications from this build as patches to your
installation using the 'otp_patch_apply' tool. For information on install
requirements, see descriptions for each application version below.

# common_test-1.27.4

The common_test-1.27.4 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change, cth_surefire hook module handles group path reduction for a
  skipped group. This fixes a bug manifesting with improper group path for a
  group executed after a group which was skipped.

  Own Id: OTP-19365
  Related Id(s): ERIERL-1157, PR-9080

## Improvements and New Features

- With this change, prefix option can be specified in cth_conn_log option list.
  Option allows to specify how much of additional information is added in raw
  log output.

# compiler-8.5.3

The compiler-8.5.3 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- In rare circumstances, the destructive tuple update optimization could be
  applied when it was unsafe.

  Own Id: OTP-19340
  Related Id(s): GH-9014, PR-9024

- In rare circumstances involving appending to multiple binaries, the compile
  could emit unsafe code that would crash the runtime system.

# erts-15.1.3

The erts-15.1.3 application can be applied independently of other applications
on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- gen_udp:send on domain local can leak inet_reply messages.

  Own Id: OTP-19332
  Related Id(s): #8989

- net:getifaddrs does not properly report the running flag on windows.

# kernel-10.1.2

Note! The kernel-10.1.2 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- erts-15.1 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- On windows the socket:recv could return with success ({ok, Data}) even though
  not all data had been read.

- gen_udp:send on domain local can leak inet_reply messages.

  Own Id: OTP-19332

- Failure to create an UDP IPv6 socket when inet_backend = socket with certain
  IPv6 socket options.

  Own Id: OTP-19357

- net:getifaddrs does not properly report the running flag on windows.

# public_key-1.16.4

The public_key-1.16.4 application can be applied independently of other
applications on a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- If both `ext-key-usage` and `key-usage` are defined for a certificate it
  should be checked that these usages are consistent with each other. This will
  have the affect that such certificates where the `ext-key-usages` is marked as
  critical and the usages is consistent with the `key-use` it can be considered
  valid without mandatory application specific checks for the `ext-key-useage`
  extension.

  Own Id: OTP-19240
  Related Id(s): PR-8840, OTP-19532

- Handle decoding of EDDSA key properly, when decoding a PEM file that contains
  only the public EDDSA key.

# ssh-5.2.4

The ssh-5.2.4 application can be applied independently of other applications on
a full OTP 27 installation.

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- With this change, ssh connection does not crash upon receiving exit-signal
  message for an already terminated channel.

# ssl-11.2.5

Note! The ssl-11.2.5 application _cannot_ be applied independently of other
applications on an arbitrary OTP 27 installation.

       On a full OTP 27 installation, also the following runtime
       dependency has to be satisfied:
       -- public_key-1.16.4 (first satisfied in OTP 27.1.3)

## Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions

- Avoid generating an internal alert for case that should have been an orderly
  shutdown by the supervisor.

  Own Id: OTP-19311
  Related Id(s): PR-8980

- If present, extended key-usage TLS (SSL) role check (`pk-clientAuth`,
  `pk-serverAuth`) should always be performed for peer-cert. An intermediate CA
  cert may relax the requirement if `AnyExtendedKeyUsage` purpose is present.

  In OTP-25.3.2.8, OTP-26.2 and OTP-27.0 these requirements became too relaxed.
  There where two problems, firstly the peer cert extension was only checked if
  it was marked critical, and secondly the CA cert check did not assert the
  relaxed `AnyExtendedKeyUsage` purpose.

  This could result in that certificates might be misused for purposes not
  intended by the certificate authority.

  Thanks to Bryan Paxton for reporting the issue.

## Improvements and New Features

- Back port certificate_authorities option for TLS-1.3 servers to pre TLS-1.3
  servers to enable them to disable the sending of certificate authorities in
  their certificate request. This will have same affect as the the TLS-1.3
  server option although it is handled by a different mechanism in these
  versions, where the functionality is described to be more of a guidance,
  although some pre TLS clients have proven to make it mandatory as in TLS-1.3
  extension handling.
