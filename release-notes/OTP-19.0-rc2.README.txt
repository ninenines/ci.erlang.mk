  OTP-10267    Application(s): erts

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The tracing support has been extended to allow a tracer
               module to be the trace event handler instead of a
               process or port. The tracer module makes it possible
               for trace tools to filter or manipulate trace event
               data without the trace event first haing to be copied
               from the traced process or port.

               With the introduction of this feature,
               erlang:trace(all|existing, _, _) now also returns the
               tracer process as part of the number of processes on
               which tracing is enabled. The is incompatible with the
               previous releases.


  OTP-12345    Application(s): erts, runtime_tools

               Add microstate accounting

               Microstate accounting is a way to track which state the
               different threads within ERTS are in. The main usage
               area is to pin point performance bottlenecks by
               checking which states the threads are in and then from
               there figuring out why and where to optimize.

               Since checking whether microstate accounting is on or
               off is relatively expensive only a few of the states
               are enabled by default and more states can be enabled
               through configure.

               There is a convinence module called msacc that has been
               added to runtime_tools that can assist in gathering and
               interpreting the data from Microstate accounting.

               For more information see
               erlang:statistics(microstate_accounting, _) and the
               msacc module in runtime_tools.

               Sharing preserved copy for messages and exit signals

               Enable sharing preserved copy with configure option
               --enable-sharing-preserving. This will preserve
               sharing, within the process, when communication with
               other processes in the Erlang node. There is a
               trade-off, the copy is more costly but this cost can be
               reclaimed if there is a lot of sharing in the message.
               With this feature enabled literals will not be copied
               in a send except during a purge phase of the module
               where the literals are located. This feature is
               considered experimental in 19.0.


  OTP-13058    Application(s): mnesia

               Added experimental external backend plugin api. This
               adds the possibility for the user to write other
               storage backends for data, for example by using shared
               memory or ram-cached disk storage.

               The plugin api may change in future versions after
               being battle tested.


  OTP-13059    Application(s): compiler, stdlib

               The pre-processor can now expand the ?FUNCTION_NAME and

  OTP-13065    Application(s): stdlib
               Related Id(s): PR-960

               A new behaviour gen_statem has been implemented. It has
               been thoroughly reviewed, is stable enough to be used
               by at least two heavy OTP applications, and is here to
               stay. But depending on user feedback, we do not expect
               but might find it necessary to make minor not backwards
               compatible changes into OTP-20.0, so its state can be
               designated as "not quite experimental"...

               The gen_statem behaviour is intended to replace gen_fsm
               for new code. It has the same features and add some
               really useful:

               -- State code is gathered

               -- The state can be any term

               -- Events can be postponed

               -- Events can be self generated

               -- A reply can be sent from a later state

               -- There can be multiple sys traceable replies

               The callback model(s) for gen_statem differs from the
               one for gen_fsm, but it is still fairly easy to rewrite
               from gen_fsm to gen_statem.


  OTP-13366    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): OTP-13047

               Introduction of configurable management of data
               referred to by the message queue of a process. Each
               process can be configured individually.

               It is now possible to configure the message queue of a
               process, so that all data referred by it will be kept
               outside of the heap, and by this prevent this data from
               being part of garbage collections.

               For more information see the documentation of
               process_flag(message_queue_data, MQD).


  OTP-13464    Application(s): ssl

               ssl now uses gen_statem instead of gen_fsm to implement
               the ssl connection process, this solves some timing
               issues in addtion to making the code more intuitive as
               the behaviour can be used cleanly instead of having a
               lot of workaround for shortcomings of the behaviour.


  OTP-13496    Application(s): erts

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The tracing support has been extended to allow tracing
               on ports. Ports can be traced on using the 'ports',
               'send' and 'receive' trace flags.

               The first argument of erlang:trace/3 has been extended
               so that 'all', 'existing' and 'new' now include both
               processes and ports. New Tracee variants,
               'all_processes', 'all_ports', 'existing_processes' etc
               have been added to specify only processes or ports.


  OTP-13503    Application(s): erts

               The erts internal tracing support has been changed to
               have much less overhead and be more scalable.

               This rewrite does not break any backwards
               incompatabilities, but it does change the ordering of
               some trace messages when compared to previous releases.
               It should be noted that this only applies to trace
               messages sent to processes or ports, it does not apply
               to the new tracer module. However in future releases
               they may also be effected by this.

               Trace messages are only guaranteed to be ordered from
               one traced process or port. In previous releases this
               was not visible as a 'send' trace message would always
               arrive before the corresponding 'receive' trace message
               that is no longer always the case. This also means that
               timestamped trace messages may seem to arrive out of
               order as the timestamp is taken when the event is
               triggered and not when it is put in the queue of the
               tracer.

  OTP-11879    Application(s): stdlib

               Undocumented syntax for function specifications, -spec
               F/A :: Domain -> Range, has been removed (without
               deprecation).

               Using the is_subtype(V, T) syntax for constraints (in
               function specifications) is no longer documented, and
               the newer syntax V :: T should be used instead. The
               Erlang Parser still recognizes the is_subtype syntax,
               and will continue to do so for some time.


  OTP-12719    Application(s): stdlib

               Background: In record fields with a type declaration
               but without an initializer, the Erlang parser inserted
               automatically the singleton type 'undefined' to the
               list of declared types, if that value was not present
               there. That is, the record declaration:

               -record(rec, {f1 :: float(), f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3
               :: some_mod:some_typ()}).

               was translated by the parser to:

               -record(rec, {f1 :: float() | 'undefined', f2 = 42 ::
               integer(), f3 :: some_mod:some_typ() | 'undefined'}).

               The rationale for this was that creation of a "dummy"
               #rec{} record should not result in a warning from
               dialyzer that, for example, the implicit initialization
               of the #rec.f1 field violates its type declaration.

               Problems: This seemingly innocent action has some
               unforeseen consequences.

               For starters, there is no way for programmers to
               declare that e.g. only floats make sense for the f1
               field of #rec{} records when there is no "obvious"
               default initializer for this field. (This also affects
               tools like PropEr that use these declarations produced
               by the Erlang parser to generate random instances of
               records for testing purposes.)

               It also means that dialyzer does not warn if e.g. an
               is_atom/1 test or something more exotic like an
               atom_to_list/1 call is performed on the value of the f1
               field.

               Similarly, there is no way to extend dialyzer to warn
               if it finds record constructions where f1 is not
               initialized to some float.

               Last but not least, it is semantically problematic when
               the type of the field is an opaque type: creating a
               union of an opaque and a structured type is very
               problematic for analysis because it fundamentally
               breaks the opacity of the term at that point.

               Change: To solve these problems the parser will not
               automatically insert the 'undefined' value anymore;
               instead the user has the option to choose the places
               where this value makes sense (for the field) and where
               it does not and insert the | 'undefined' there
               manually.

               Consequences of this change: This change means that
               dialyzer will issue a warning for all places where
               records with uninitialized fields are created and those
               fields have a declared type that is incompatible with
               'undefined' (e.g. float()). This warning can be
               suppressed easily by adding | 'undefined' to the type
               of this field. This also adds documentation that the
               user really intends to create records where this field
               is uninitialized.


  OTP-12863    Application(s): syntax_tools

               The abstract data type in erl_syntax is augmented with
               types and function specifications.

               The module erl_prettypr pretty prints types and
               function specification, and the output can be parsed.

               The types of record fields are no longer ignored. As a
               consequence erl_syntax_lib:analyze_record_field/1
               returns {Default, Type} instead of Default. The
               functions analyze_record_attribute, analyze_attribute,
               analyze_form, and analyze_forms in the erl_syntax_lib
               module are also affected by this incompatible change.


  OTP-13088    Application(s): erts

               The functionality behind erlang:open_port/2 when called
               with spawn or spawn_executable has been redone so that
               the forking of the new program is done in a separate
               process called erl_child_setup. This allows for a much
               more robust implementation that uses less memory and
               does not block the entire emulator if the program to be
               started is on an un-accessible NFS. Benchmarks have
               shown this approach to be about 3-5 times as fast as
               the old approach where the fork/vfork was done by erts.
               This is a pure stability and performance fix, however
               some error messages may have changed, which is why it
               is marked as a backwards incompatible change.


  OTP-13148    Application(s): stdlib

               Background: The types of record fields have since R12B
               been put in a separate form by epp:parse_file(),
               leaving the record declaration form untyped. The
               separate form, however, does not follow the syntax of
               type declarations, and parse transforms inspecting
               -type() attributes need to know about the special
               syntax. Since the compiler stores the return value of
               epp:parse_file() as debug information in the abstract
               code chunk ("Abst" or abstract_code), tools too need to
               know about the special syntax, if they inspect -type()
               attributes in abstract code.

               Change: No separate type form is created by
               epp:parse_file(), but the type information is kept in
               the record fields. This means that all parse transforms
               and all tools inspecting -record() declarations need to
               recognize {typed_record_field, Field, Type}.

  OTP-13496    Application(s): erts

               *** HIGHLIGHT ***

               The tracing support has been extended to allow tracing
               on ports. Ports can be traced on using the 'ports',
               'send' and 'receive' trace flags.

               The first argument of erlang:trace/3 has been extended
               so that 'all', 'existing' and 'new' now include both
               processes and ports. New Tracee variants,
               'all_processes', 'all_ports', 'existing_processes' etc
               have been added to specify only processes or ports.


  OTP-13497    Application(s): erts

               When the 'procs' trace flag is enabled, a 'spawned'
               trace event is now also generated by a newly created
               process. The previous event 'spawn' remains, but as it
               is generated by the process that did the spawn, it is
               not guaranteed that it is ordered with other trace
               events from the newly spawned process. So when tracking
               the lifetime of a process this new event should be used
               as the creation event.

               This new trace event is marked as an incompatabiliy
               because tools that expect certain trace events when
               enabling 'procs' will have to updated.


  OTP-13504    Application(s): compiler

               The compiler will no longer put the compilation date

               source code and compilation options will be identical.

               Note: If you want to find out whether a BEAM file on
               disk is different from the loaded code, compared the
               MD5 value obtained from Mod:module_info(md5) with the

               The shorthand ... stands for the association type any()

               An incompatible change is that #{} stands for the empty

               A process could terminate due to exit signal even

               the binary is now split into multiple slots in the io
               vector. This change only effects system where the max
               size of an io vector slot is smaller then the word size
               of the system (e.g. Windows).

               This change means that it is now possible on Windows to
               send binaries that are larger than 4GB to
               port_comnmand, which is what is used for file:write,
               gen_tcp:send etc.

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               The tracing support has been extended to allow a tracer
               module to be the trace event handler instead of a
               process or port. The tracer module makes it possible
               for trace tools to filter or manipulate trace event
               data without the trace event first haing to be copied
               from the traced process or port.

               With the introduction of this feature,
               erlang:trace(all|existing, _, _) now also returns the
               tracer process as part of the number of processes on
               which tracing is enabled. The is incompatible with the

               Add microstate accounting

               Microstate accounting is a way to track which state the
               different threads within ERTS are in. The main usage
               area is to pin point performance bottlenecks by
               checking which states the threads are in and then from
               there figuring out why and where to optimize.

               Since checking whether microstate accounting is on or
               off is relatively expensive only a few of the states
               are enabled by default and more states can be enabled
               through configure.

               There is a convinence module called msacc that has been
               added to runtime_tools that can assist in gathering and
               interpreting the data from Microstate accounting.

               For more information see
               erlang:statistics(microstate_accounting, _) and the

               do some asynchronous initialization, for example
               getting configuration from a pipe, and you want the
               initial open_port call to fail if the configuration is

               The functionality behind erlang:open_port/2 when called
               with spawn or spawn_executable has been redone so that
               the forking of the new program is done in a separate
               process called erl_child_setup. This allows for a much
               more robust implementation that uses less memory and
               does not block the entire emulator if the program to be
               started is on an un-accessible NFS. Benchmarks have
               shown this approach to be about 3-5 times as fast as
               the old approach where the fork/vfork was done by erts.
               This is a pure stability and performance fix, however
               some error messages may have changed, which is why it
               is marked as a backwards incompatible change.

               The enif_send API has been extended to allow NULL to be
               used as the message environment. When used this way, a

               term is copied into that environment before sending.
               This can be an optimization if many small messages are
               being sent by the nif.

               The tracing support has been extended to allow tracing
               on ports. Ports can be traced on using the 'ports',
               'send' and 'receive' trace flags.

               The first argument of erlang:trace/3 has been extended
               so that 'all', 'existing' and 'new' now include both
               processes and ports. New Tracee variants,
               'all_processes', 'all_ports', 'existing_processes' etc
               have been added to specify only processes or ports.


  OTP-13497    Application(s): erts

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               When the 'procs' trace flag is enabled, a 'spawned'
               trace event is now also generated by a newly created
               process. The previous event 'spawn' remains, but as it
               is generated by the process that did the spawn, it is
               not guaranteed that it is ordered with other trace
               events from the newly spawned process. So when tracking
               the lifetime of a process this new event should be used
               as the creation event.

               This new trace event is marked as an incompatabiliy
               because tools that expect certain trace events when
               enabling 'procs' will have to updated.


  OTP-13501    Application(s): erts

               Add the erlang:match_spec_test/3 function. The
               functions allows the testing of match specifications
               for both tracing and ets tables. It can be used to test
               that a match specification does the expected filtering
               on specific data. It also returns more verbose error
               reasons for incorrectly constructed match
               specifications.


  OTP-13503    Application(s): erts

               *** HIGHLIGHT ***

               The erts internal tracing support has been changed to
               have much less overhead and be more scalable.

               This rewrite does not break any backwards
               incompatabilities, but it does change the ordering of
               some trace messages when compared to previous releases.
               It should be noted that this only applies to trace
               messages sent to processes or ports, it does not apply
               to the new tracer module. However in future releases
               they may also be effected by this.

               Trace messages are only guaranteed to be ordered from
               one traced process or port. In previous releases this
               was not visible as a 'send' trace message would always
               arrive before the corresponding 'receive' trace message
               that is no longer always the case. This also means that
               timestamped trace messages may seem to arrive out of
               order as the timestamp is taken when the event is
               triggered and not when it is put in the queue of the
               tracer.

               *** HIGHLIGHT ***

               Add microstate accounting

               Microstate accounting is a way to track which state the
               different threads within ERTS are in. The main usage
               area is to pin point performance bottlenecks by
               checking which states the threads are in and then from
               there figuring out why and where to optimize.

               Since checking whether microstate accounting is on or
               off is relatively expensive only a few of the states
               are enabled by default and more states can be enabled
               through configure.

               There is a convinence module called msacc that has been
               added to runtime_tools that can assist in gathering and
               interpreting the data from Microstate accounting.

               For more information see
               erlang:statistics(microstate_accounting, _) and the
               msacc module in runtime_tools.

  OTP-13267    Application(s): ssh

               The ssh_connection_handler module in SSH is changed and
               now uses the new behaviour gen_statem.

               The module can be used as an example of a gen_statem
               callback module but with a warning: This commit of ssh
               is just a straightforward port from gen_fsm to
               gen_statem with some code cleaning. Since the state
               machine and the state callbacks are almost unchanged
               the ssh module does not demonstrate the full potential
               of the new behaviour.

               The "new" state machine uses compund states. The ssh
               server and client state machines are quite similar but
               differences exist. With gen_fsm there were flags in the
               user data which in fact implemented "substates". Now
               with gen_statem those are made explicit in the state
               names, eg the state userauth and the binary role-flag
               becomes the two state names {userauth, server} and
               {userauth, client}.

               ssl now uses gen_statem instead of gen_fsm to implement
               the ssl connection process, this solves some timing
               issues in addtion to making the code more intuitive as
               the behaviour can be used cleanly instead of having a
               lot of workaround for shortcomings of the behaviour.

  OTP-12719    Application(s): stdlib

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Background: In record fields with a type declaration
               but without an initializer, the Erlang parser inserted
               automatically the singleton type 'undefined' to the
               list of declared types, if that value was not present
               there. That is, the record declaration:

               -record(rec, {f1 :: float(), f2 = 42 :: integer(), f3
               :: some_mod:some_typ()}).

               was translated by the parser to:

               -record(rec, {f1 :: float() | 'undefined', f2 = 42 ::
               integer(), f3 :: some_mod:some_typ() | 'undefined'}).

               The rationale for this was that creation of a "dummy"
               #rec{} record should not result in a warning from
               dialyzer that, for example, the implicit initialization
               of the #rec.f1 field violates its type declaration.

               Problems: This seemingly innocent action has some
               unforeseen consequences.

               For starters, there is no way for programmers to
               declare that e.g. only floats make sense for the f1
               field of #rec{} records when there is no "obvious"
               default initializer for this field. (This also affects
               tools like PropEr that use these declarations produced
               by the Erlang parser to generate random instances of
               records for testing purposes.)

               It also means that dialyzer does not warn if e.g. an
               is_atom/1 test or something more exotic like an
               atom_to_list/1 call is performed on the value of the f1
               field.

               Similarly, there is no way to extend dialyzer to warn
               if it finds record constructions where f1 is not
               initialized to some float.

               Last but not least, it is semantically problematic when
               the type of the field is an opaque type: creating a
               union of an opaque and a structured type is very
               problematic for analysis because it fundamentally
               breaks the opacity of the term at that point.

               Change: To solve these problems the parser will not
               automatically insert the 'undefined' value anymore;
               instead the user has the option to choose the places
               where this value makes sense (for the field) and where
               it does not and insert the | 'undefined' there
               manually.

               Consequences of this change: This change means that
               dialyzer will issue a warning for all places where
               records with uninitialized fields are created and those
               fields have a declared type that is incompatible with
               'undefined' (e.g. float()). This warning can be
               suppressed easily by adding | 'undefined' to the type
               of this field. This also adds documentation that the
               user really intends to create records where this field
               is uninitialized.

               *** HIGHLIGHT ***

               A new behaviour gen_statem has been implemented. It has
               been thoroughly reviewed, is stable enough to be used
               by at least two heavy OTP applications, and is here to
               stay. But depending on user feedback, we do not expect
               but might find it necessary to make minor not backwards
               compatible changes into OTP-20.0, so its state can be
               designated as "not quite experimental"...

               The gen_statem behaviour is intended to replace gen_fsm
               for new code. It has the same features and add some
               really useful:

               -- State code is gathered

               -- The state can be any term

               -- Events can be postponed

               -- Events can be self generated

               -- A reply can be sent from a later state

               -- There can be multiple sys traceable replies

               The callback model(s) for gen_statem differs from the
               one for gen_fsm, but it is still fairly easy to rewrite
               from gen_fsm to gen_statem.

  OTP-13148    Application(s): stdlib

               *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

               Background: The types of record fields have since R12B
               been put in a separate form by epp:parse_file(),
               leaving the record declaration form untyped. The
               separate form, however, does not follow the syntax of
               type declarations, and parse transforms inspecting
               -type() attributes need to know about the special
               syntax. Since the compiler stores the return value of
               epp:parse_file() as debug information in the abstract
               code chunk ("Abst" or abstract_code), tools too need to
               know about the special syntax, if they inspect -type()
               attributes in abstract code.

               Change: No separate type form is created by
               epp:parse_file(), but the type information is kept in
               the record fields. This means that all parse transforms
               and all tools inspecting -record() declarations need to
               recognize {typed_record_field, Field, Type}.
