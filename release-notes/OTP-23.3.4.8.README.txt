 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-17628    Application(s): erts

               A call to process_info(Pid, status) could erroneously
               report the status running when it should have reported
               waiting. This occurred when the calling process was
               executing on a higher priority than the process being
               inspected. This bug has been present since OTP 21.0
               (erts version 10.0).


  OTP-17642    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): PR-5248

               A race between an exiting port and handling of
               simultaneously received signals to that port could
               cause a runtime system crash. The effected signals are
               link, monitor and demonitor. On OTP 22 a similiar race
               could also cause a memory leak when receiving an unlink
               signal.


  OTP-17651    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): GH-5235, PR-5244

               The message queue of a process entered an inconsistent
               state after a receive expression with an invalid
               timeout value was executed. If the exception raised due
               to the invalid timeout value was caught, the following
               receive expression executed by the process could fail
               to match messages already present in the message queue.

               On OTP 24 this could also cause the whole runtime
               system to crash.


  OTP-17665    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): PR-5248

               Sending a Port ! {PortOwner, close} signal from a
               process other than the port owner could erroneously
               trigger a badsig exit signal being sent to the port
               owner process even though the correct PortOwner had
               been passed in the signal.


  OTP-17677    Application(s): erts

               This fixes a bug in erts_factory_undo that caused the
               heap to not be reset correctly. The erts_factory_undo
               function is, for example, called when a
               binary_to_term/1 call fails to reset the heap to its
               state before the binary_to_term/1 call. This can cause
               the heap to contain invalid terms which potentially can
               cause issues (e.g., crashes) when the whole heap is
               scanned.


  OTP-17700    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): GH-5271, PR-5273

               Fix bug in persistent_term when a key-value pair
               contains a magic reference that is referred more than
               once. Magic references are NIF resources or returned
               from BIFs like ets:new, atomics:new. The bug could
               cause the memory of the referred resource to be
               prematurely deallocated.

               The bug also apply to magic references in message
               passing on a runtime built with configure option
               --enable-sharing-preserving.

               Bug exist for 64-bit since OTP-24.0 and for 32-bit
               since OTP-20.0.


 --- Improvements and New Features ---

  OTP-17658    Application(s): erts

               The python scripts that existed in
               erts/lib_src/yielding_c_fun/lib/tiny_regex_c/scripts
               had a license that was incompatible with Erlang/OTP's
               license. This ticket removes these scripts that were
               not used by us.

  OTP-17707    Application(s): ssh
               Related Id(s): ERIERL-706

               The value of the connect_timeout option is now used as
               default value for the negotiation timeout.
