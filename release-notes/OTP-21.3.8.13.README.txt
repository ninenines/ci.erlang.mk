 --- erts-10.3.5.9 ---------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Note! The erts-10.3.5.9 application *cannot* be applied independently
       of other applications on an arbitrary OTP 21 installation.

       On a full OTP 21 installation, also the following runtime
       dependencies have to be satisfied:
       -- kernel-6.1 (first satisfied in OTP 21.1)
       -- sasl-3.3 (first satisfied in OTP 21.2)


 --- Fixed Bugs and Malfunctions ---

  OTP-16436    Application(s): erts
               Related Id(s): ERL-1152

               A process could end up in a state where it got
               endlessly rescheduled without making any progress. This
               occurred when a system task, such as check of process
               code (part of a code purge), was scheduled on a high
               priority process trying to execute on a dirty
               scheduler.


  OTP-16438    Application(s): erts

               Fixed bug in erlang:list_to_ref/1 when called with a
               reference created by a remote note. Function
               list_to_ref/1 is intended for debugging and not to be
               used in application programs. Bug exist since OTP 20.0.

 --- stdlib-3.8.2.3 --------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

 The stdlib-3.8.2.3 application can be applied independently of other
 applications on a full OTP 21 installation.

  OTP-16441    Application(s): stdlib

               A directory traversal vulnerability has been eliminated
               in erl_tar. erl_tar will now refuse to extract symlinks
               that points outside the targeted extraction directory
               and will return {error,{Path,unsafe_symlink}}. (Thanks
               to Eric Meadows-JÃ¶nsson for the bug report and for
               suggesting a fix.)
